"""The protected-path two-step landing stays removed.

Owner ruling, 2026-09-27: "remove all such two-step push! THAT IS USELESS!"
A change to landing code used to need two landings -- one recording the new
bytes in a byte register as `next`, one promoting them to `current` -- checked
by a validator the merge verifier ran.  That register, its validator and its
tools were deleted, and the verifier now runs every arm on the raw-attested
BASE snapshot, so a landing-code change takes effect once it has landed.

FAILS if any removed file comes back, or if a live landing entry point calls
one again.  Each removed path and each caller is named individually, so a
failure sends the reader to one file.  The names are assembled from parts so
that this file is not itself a hit for the repository-wide removal grep.
