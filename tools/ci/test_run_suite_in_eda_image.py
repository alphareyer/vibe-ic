"""`tools/ci/run_suite_in_eda_image.sh` — the harness that makes the container
engine reachable where the suite runs.

WHAT THIS FILE REFUSES
======================
1. **A remapped bind.** The harness hands the HOST daemon paths that were
   composed inside the container, so a path that is not identical on both sides
   is not an error — Docker creates an empty directory and mounts that. Measured
   on this harness with the socket already working: the CLI ran, the arm reached
   container creation, and the daemon answered `bind source path does not exist:
   /tmp/vibeic-hermetic-dsz78fvv/progress-plan.json`.
2. **The sandbox being handed the socket.** The harness is the OUTER
   environment; the hermetic arms it lets the suite launch are the sandbox, and
   an arm runs unreviewed candidate code. Giving one the host daemon is the
   removal of the gate, not a repair of it.
3. **A scratch root the external-storage gate cannot see** — the falsifying root
   that turns honest passes into failures naming their own fixtures. How many
   is not written here: it is stated, and re-measured every run, by
   `_VOLATILE_ADVISORY` in `programs/scratch_root_guard.py` (0 at 4b3843f22c,
   which is why the GUARD declares this condition instead of refusing on it;
   this harness pins its own `--scratch` for a different reason, stated there).
4. **An absent engine reported as anything other than a refusal.** "I could not
   look" is not a test verdict, and a `which("docker")` skip in the suite would
   delete the landing gate's only end-to-end proof.
5. **A session that collected nothing, read as a clean one** (vibe-ic#2123). The
   harness runs pytest with the PLUGIN directory as the working directory, so a
   repo-root-relative selector after `--` resolves under the plugin directory,
   where it does not exist. MEASURED 2026-09-07 on 8hd-3 in the pinned image:
   `-- -q tools/ci/test_gatekeeper_status_poller.py` ended
   `[PASS] suite_write_guard: ...` / `no tests ran in 0.07s` /
   `ERROR: file or directory not found: ...`, rc 4. Nothing ran, no line said
   so, and the last verdict-shaped line was a PASS. A selector that names
   nothing here is now refused BY NAME before any container starts, and pytest
   exit 4 and exit 5 are refusals with a line of the harness's own.
