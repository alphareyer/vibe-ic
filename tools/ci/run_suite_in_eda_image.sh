#!/usr/bin/env bash
# run_suite_in_eda_image.sh — run the plugin test suite (or the landing gate)
# inside the digest-pinned EDA image WITH a reachable container engine.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
# ====================
# The suite carries a mandatory negative control that DRIVES the container
# engine: `tools/ci/trusted_test_selection.py::CONTROL_TESTS` pins
# `programs/tests/test_landing_merge_verdict.py` into every landing's
# denominator, and 23 of its 138 tests execute `tools/gatekeeper-verify-merge.sh`
# end to end, which launches the hermetic B1/B2/A1/A2 arms through
# `tools/ci/hermetic_candidate_runner.py`.
#
# MEASURED on ae5cc4dbfc3f (tree 954bc27704cb), `ghcr.io/vibeic/vibeic-eda@sha256:
# 66c33ff2…` (tag 0.3.6, image id b8b65ea3af6e):
#
#     command -v docker            ->  (nothing)
#     ls /var/run/docker.sock      ->  No such file or directory
#
# so `Docker.call` raises at its first invocation and the gate prints
#
#     [NORECORD] hermetic candidate: cannot execute Docker CLI:
#         [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'docker'
#     gatekeeper-verify-merge: B1 arm receipt is NORECORD
#
# for every one of those 23. On the host, the same file is green. The failure is
# a property of WHERE the suite was run, not of the tree — and the answer is NOT
# to skip the file. It exists because a red suite survived five `gh pr merge`
# squashes; a `which("docker")` skip would delete the landing gate's only
# end-to-end proof in the one place it routinely runs.
#
# So this harness makes the engine REACHABLE where the suite runs, instead.
#
# WHY DOCKER-OUT-OF-DOCKER AND NOT DOCKER-IN-DOCKER
# =================================================
# The container this script starts is a HARNESS, not a sandbox. It is the outer
# environment the suite runs in — the stand-in for "the host". The arms the
# suite launches from inside it are the sandbox, and they are untouched: the
# runner still gives them `--network none`, a read-only rootfs, `--cap-drop ALL`,
# `no-new-privileges` and uid 65534, and it still refuses a writable subject
# bind. NOTHING in this file relaxes an arm.
#
# The hermetic ARM itself must never be given this socket. An arm executes
# UNREVIEWED candidate code; handing it the host daemon would give that code
# root on the machine that is judging it, including the ability to rewrite the
# very tree under test. That is the removal of the gate, not a repair of it.
#
# THE IDENTICAL-PATH RULE, AND WHY IT IS A REFUSAL
# ================================================
# With the host socket bound in, `docker run -v A:B` issued from INSIDE this
# container is resolved by the HOST daemon, so `A` is read on the HOST
# filesystem. A path that exists only inside the container does not error: the
# daemon CREATES an empty directory and mounts that. The arm then runs against
# an empty subject and reports something false rather than nothing.
#
# Every path this harness makes visible is therefore mounted at its OWN path —
# host path == container path — and anything that cannot be is a refusal, never
# a remapping.
#
# `/tmp` IS ONE OF THOSE PATHS, AND IT IS NOT OPTIONAL. Sharing the repo and the
# scratch root is not enough:
#
#     tools/ci/hermetic_candidate_runner.py:1840
#         runtime_dir = Path(tempfile.mkdtemp(prefix="vibeic-hermetic-", dir="/tmp"))
#
# `dir="/tmp"` is hardcoded on purpose — that private transport directory must
# not follow `TMPDIR` and must not land under `HOME`. It holds the arm's
# progress plan, the selection and the stdout/stderr sinks, and every one of
# them is handed to the daemon as a bind SOURCE. With only the repo shared, the
# CLI works, the arm gets all the way to container creation, and then:
#
#     [NORECORD] hermetic candidate: candidate container creation failed:
#         invalid mount config for type "bind": bind source path does not
#         exist: /tmp/vibeic-hermetic-dsz78fvv/progress-plan.json
#
# — MEASURED, on this harness, with the socket already working. That is the
# identical-path trap arriving one step later, and it is why the rule is stated
# as "every path", not "the interesting paths".
#
# THE ACCOUNT HOME IS PART OF THE RUNTIME, NOT DECORATION
# =======================================================
# `hermetic_candidate_runner._home_path()` resolves `pwd.getpwuid(os.getuid())`
# strictly and REFUSES every mount when it cannot. The pinned image has no
# passwd entry for uid 1000, so a bare `--user 1000` run NORECORDs before it
# ever looks for the engine (measured: "cannot resolve the host account home:
# 'getpwuid(): uid not found: 1000'"). This harness therefore supplies a passwd
# entry, and puts that home in a SIBLING of the scratch root rather than an
# ancestor of it — a scratch root under the account home is refused by
# `_resolve_mount` for a different reason, which `programs/scratch_root_guard.py`
# documents.
#
# THE SCRATCH ROOT IS PINNED, NOT INHERITED
# =========================================
# `TMPDIR` is set to a directory under a VOLATILE root (`/tmp`, `/var/tmp`,
# `/dev/shm`, `/run`). Tests in this suite build their subject at `tmp_path` and
# ask `programs/project_outputs_in_tree_check.py` to classify it as external
# storage; that gate matches those four prefixes and nothing else, so a scratch
# root anywhere else turns honest passes into failures that name their own
# subject and never the root. `programs/scratch_root_guard.py` DECLARES such a
# root by name; this harness never creates one.
#
# HOW MANY IT COSTS IS NOT WRITTEN HERE, DELIBERATELY. This comment said "six"
# and was wrong by the time anyone read it: `test_issue146_collect_external_
# outputs.py` grew a `volatile_dir` fixture in fc32402c8 and stopped costing
# its 4, while `test_issue1446_scratch_root_guard.py` was costing 6 and had
# never been counted (measured on ded6aa231a68: 8, not 6). The count lives in
# `_VOLATILE_ADVISORY` in the guard, where
# `test_every_line_of_this_cost_table_fires` re-measures it every run.
#
# IT IS NOW 0, AND THE GUARD NO LONGER REFUSES ON IT (re-measured 4b3843f22c:
# every test that exercises the gate pins its own volatile subject, so none of
# them depends on where `tmp_path` lands). THIS HARNESS STILL PINS ITS OWN
# SCRATCH ROOT, and the reason is no longer the count: `--scratch` is a shape
# this harness GUARANTEES to whatever runs inside it, not an environment it
# inherited, and it costs the caller one argument to satisfy. That is a
# different argument from the guard's, written down here so the two are not
# confused — the guard adjudicates an operator's environment and now declares
# rather than refuses; this adjudicates its own parameter.
#
# --no-engine IS A CONTROL, NOT A MODE
# ====================================
# It withholds the engine on purpose so the 23 can be brought back on demand. A
# repair that cannot be undone into the original failure was not measured.
#
# chip-AGNOSTIC: harness/environment structure only; no design, PDK or vendor

# a host was told to fetch the bytes. MEASURED 2026-09-07: 8HD-8 holds the pin
# under both `ghcr.io/vibeic/vibeic-eda` and the fleet mirror, 8HD-9 under the

# string for an image that is on the machine.
#
# AND HERE IT IS WORSE THAN A REFUSAL. There is no `--pull=never` on the
# `docker run` calls below, so an unresolvable reference does not fail fast: it
# starts fetching a ~22 GB image inside a landing gate. This block asks the
# right question first -- "does this host hold an image whose repo digest IS
# the pin, under ANY repository" -- and answers it from LOCAL metadata only.
#
# NOT WIDENED: only a reference whose digest is the pin is accepted, so a
# different digest is refused exactly as strictly as before, and if nothing
# local carries it this dies rather than pulling.
#
# NOT SILENT: a substitution names BOTH references. An operator who sets
# VIBEIC_EDA_IMAGE_REPO and is quietly served the same bytes from elsewhere has
# been given a knob that does nothing.

#

#                /foss/tools/klayout/pymod and the dist-packages chain. THE FORKED

#   says the setup ran at all.
#
# A suite must run in the environment the image ships. Anything measured through
# the bypass was measured against a different one.
#

# bypass — it runs entirely AFTER the entrypoint, on what the entrypoint wrote.

# `/tmp` at its own path, so `/tmp/passwd` is one shared mutable file and the
# last container to start wins it — for every lane on the box, not just ours.
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-07 on 8HD-9, and it is not theoretical: an A/B of this suite
# through the entrypoint against `--entrypoint /bin/sh`, same tree, same 377
# nodes, moved ELEVEN nodes from passed to skipped, all of them in
# `test_issue1446_scratch_root_guard.py`, all with one reason —
#     "cannot resolve the host account home: [Errno 2] ... '/var/tmp/czh_pr1'"
# `/var/tmp/czh_pr1` was ANOTHER container of this lane, started seconds
# earlier. The session resolved its account home out of a file a different run
# owned, and eleven checks about the account home reported SKIPPED rather than
# saying they had been handed someone else's answer.
#
# So the session copies the entrypoint's own output to a per-run path under the
# scratch and re-points nss_wrapper at the copy, then CHECKS that the home it
# resolves is the one this run supplied and refuses by name if it is not. A

# ── THE SUMMARY LINE, AND THE TWO EXIT CODES THAT MEAN NOTHING RAN ────────
# This harness used to end here, handing pytest's exit code back with nothing of
# its own to say. That is what made vibe-ic#2123 readable as clean: the last
# verdict-shaped line in the stream belonged to the in-suite write guard
# ([PASS] suite_write_guard: ...), the summary said "no tests ran", and no line
# in the whole output said the harness itself had produced no verdict.
#
# So every run now ends with ONE line of this harness's own, and the two exit
# codes that mean the session collected nothing are REFUSALS.
#
#     4  pytest's usage error — what a selector naming no file produces
#     5  pytest's EXIT_NO_TESTS_COLLECTED — an empty collection, including one
#        emptied by -k / -m / --deselect after collection
#
# rc 4 IS NOT A HYPOTHETICAL AND IT IS NOT ONLY #2123's OWN REPRODUCER. MEASURED
# 2026-09-07 on 8hd-3, through this harness, on the pinned digest:
#
#     -- -q --timeout=30 <an absolute selector that exists>
#     __main__.py: error: unrecognized arguments: --timeout=30       rc 4
#
# pytest-timeout is not installed in that image, so a CI command line carrying
# `--timeout=` runs NOTHING and, before this block, said so only in a line no
# scrape reads. Stated as a measurement with its date because it is one: if the
# image later ships the plugin, this paragraph is still true about the digest it
# names, and the refusal above claims nothing about any particular option.
#
# Both are non-zero already; being non-zero was never the problem. The problem
# is that their OUTPUT is indistinguishable from a clean run to everything that
# reads it by text, and this stream is read by text:
#
#   tools/core_agent/covered_by.py::classify_run          - FAILED on "no tests ran"
#   tools/ci/gatekeeper_status_poller.py::classify        - error on _NOTHING_RAN
#   programs/pytest_per_file_junit.py::_zero_collect      - rc 5 recorded, never green
#
# Those three already refuse a zero-collect run; they are named here so that the
# harness's own line agrees with them instead of being the one reader that does
# not. `programs/tests/test_bidirectional_controls_are_executed.py` asks the
# same question of a file rather than of a run.
#
# The exit code becomes 2 — this harness's own REFUSED code, the one `die` uses
# — and the original pytest code is named in the text so nothing is lost.
