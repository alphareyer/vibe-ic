"""assign_version.py — the ONE command that assigns the next plugin version.

    tools/release/assign_version.py --next patch|minor [--repo DIR] [--dry-run]
                                    [--json OUT]

WHY THIS EXISTS (vibe-ic#2350)
==============================
MEASURED 2026-09-17 on e9135ccd0: `plugin.json`, both `marketplace.json` and the
README prose said 1.21.6, last moved by 592fcf53c (2026-09-13), 417 commits and
136 first-parent landings earlier. `claude plugin update` compares nothing but
that string, so for four days every installed user was told "already at the
latest version" while the marketplace clone moved hundreds of commits ahead.

The writer existed (`programs/gatekeeper_assign_version.py --write`) and so did
every check (`marketplace_version_sync_check`, `plugin_version_prose_sync_check`,
`version_bump_monotonic_check`). What did not exist was one command a lander
runs that does the assignment AND proves it: the writer only knows `patch`, and
the checks all run somewhere a `gh pr merge` landing never passes. This is that
command. It adds no second writer — it calls the existing one.

WHAT IT MAY CHANGE, AND HOW THAT IS PROVEN
==========================================
A DECLARED version position is a place the repo states the version it ships:

  * `plugin.json` `version`;
  * the `plugins[].version` of every `marketplace.json` entry whose source is
    that plugin (repo-root and nested);
  * the README claim forms `plugin_version_prose_sync_check` recognises.

Anything else that happens to spell the old version is a QUOTATION — a
docstring citing "MEASURED on plugin 1.21.6", a fixture, a corpus cell name —
and must not move. The landing chain once ran a tree-wide `sed s/$CUR/$V/g`,
and a docstring citing v1.18.84 was rewritten by twelve consecutive landings
(#2137). So the write is followed by checks that do NOT trust the writer:

  1. every file outside the declared set is byte-identical to before;
  2. every declared file equals an expectation derived HERE, independently:
     the JSON documents equal the old documents with only the declared fields
     set, and differ from the old text only on `"version"` lines; the prose
     files equal the old text with only the recognised claims rewritten;
  3. the repo's own checks agree: the manifests are in sync at the new version,
     the prose audit is PASS, and the new version is strictly greater.

Any failure RESTORES every file it wrote and exits 1, naming what was missed or
what moved that should not have. A position the writer skipped is a failure of
check 2; a quotation the writer touched is a failure of check 1 or 2.

`--dry-run` performs the same write and the same checks, prints the change, and
restores the tree — so a dry run is a measurement, not a prediction.

The mcp-eda server carries its OWN version (`mcp-eda/package.json`,
`SERVER_VERSION`), a separate line from the plugin's; it is not a declared
position of the plugin version and this command does not touch it.

EXIT CODES
    0  assigned (or, with --dry-run, assigned-verified-and-restored)
    1  refused after writing: a declared position was missed or an undeclared
       byte changed; the tree is restored
    2  bad input: no parseable current version, or the declared positions
       already disagree before the bump (fix that drift first — a bump from a
       drifted state would hide which value was right)

chip-AGNOSTIC: semver arithmetic over the repo's own version files.
