"""Provenance rows for artefacts imported from an external flow's own step logs.

WHY THIS EXISTS (plan W19, owner decision 4a, 2026-09-28)
--------------------------------------------------------
Under ``--librelane`` the layout is produced by LibreLane, not by a vibe-ic
session, and vibe-ic IMPORTS the step outputs into its canonical tree. The
provenance ledger then needs a row per imported step, and there are only two
honest shapes for it:

* **A back-fill.** The runner hashes a file it did not watch being written.
  Doctrine #365 (``phase3_one_shot_runner._restamp_provenance_output``) says
  that row is ``reconstructed: true`` with ``duration_ms: None``. Nothing here
  changes that: a back-fill is still a back-fill.
* **A witnessed run.** The owner ruled (decision 4a) that LibreLane's OWN step
  record is a witness. Such a row is ``reconstructed: false``, is attributed to
  LibreLane, and CITES its evidence by path and sha256 so any later reader can
  re-check it.

WHAT A WITNESS MUST SHOW, AND HOW EACH PART IS CHECKED
------------------------------------------------------
LibreLane prints ``Running '<id>' at '<dir>'`` in ``Step.start``, BEFORE the
step decides to skip and before ``run()`` succeeds, so a started step proves
nothing. A witness holds only when ALL of these re-verify:

1. **The run's own log, pinned.** ``flow.log`` is append-only and a run tag can
   be reused, so the witness cites the PREFIX the row was written against
   (``bytes`` + the sha256 of those bytes), never the whole file. Later
   appends leave the witness valid.
2. **The step ran a tool and did not skip.** In that prefix, the step's block
   (from its ``Running`` line to the next step outside its folder) must not
   print ``Skipping '<id>'`` or ``Returning state unaltered``, and it must
   name at least one ``Logging subprocess to '<path>'``: the transcript of a
   real tool process. A pure-Python step names none, so it can never be
   witnessed, whatever its step-id prefix.
3. **The cited logs are those transcripts.** Each cited log is named by one of
   the block's ``Logging subprocess`` lines, lies inside the step folder, and
   still has its cited sha256.
4. **The step finished.** Its ``state_out.json``, which LibreLane writes only
   after ``run()`` returns, is cited by sha256.
5. **The declared bytes are that step's bytes.** Every declared output names
   its source file in the step folder (``sources``), and the source's sha256,
   the file on disk, and the row's output digest are all equal.

``tool`` is the UNDERLYING tool (``openroad``, ``yosys``, ``magic``,
``klayout``, ``netgen``, ``verilator``), derived from the step id and never
taken from the caller, so the flow's existing ``provenance_check --tool``
allow-lists judge the row unchanged (decision 4a, not 4b). ``exit_code`` is 0
because of points 2 and 4, not because a caller said so.

Every path in the witness is relative to ``run_dir`` (itself project-
relative), the same convention as the W0 import manifest (lane llf).

THE ONE READER
--------------
The flow-log grammar is read by two calibrated instruments (see
``instrument_calibration``): ``flow_log_steps`` and ``step_block``. When one
of them may not judge, ``witnessed_row`` refuses (so the caller writes a #365
back-fill), and ``verify_witness`` returns ``UNCALIBRATED``, but only after
every check that needs no reader (the cited shas and folders of points 3-5)
has held; one that fails is a FAIL whatever the reader says. ``UNCALIBRATED``
is a NOT_MEASURED state, never a FAIL.

It writes no ``measurement`` record; see ``_runner_measurement``.

chip-AGNOSTIC: no design, PDK or corner literal. The only literals are
LibreLane's own flow-log grammar and its step-id prefixes.
