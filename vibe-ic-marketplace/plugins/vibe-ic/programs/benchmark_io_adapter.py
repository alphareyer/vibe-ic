r"""benchmark_io_adapter.py — the ONLY place a benchmark's file format may appear.

WHY THIS FILE IS ALLOWED TO KNOW BENCHMARK NAMES, AND NOTHING ELSE IS
=====================================================================
§ 0 GENERAL-CORE / THIN-ADAPTER: a benchmark-named file is legitimate ONLY as
the IO shell that maps a dataset's record format to a project layout and back.
Everything between IN and OUT is the general flow. So this module does exactly
two things, per format:

    stage(problem)   dataset record/files  ->  <project>/input/...
    collect(project) <project> artefacts   ->  the response the scorer reads

and holds no solving logic whatsoever. If you find yourself adding a rule here
about HOW to build RTL, it belongs in the general layer instead.

THE INPUT / ORACLE SPLIT IS DATA, AND IT IS ENFORCED
====================================================
Every dataset ships the answer next to the question:

    VerilogEval   Prob042_prompt.txt   INPUT
                  Prob042_ref.sv       ORACLE (the golden)
                  Prob042_test.sv      ORACLE (the grading testbench)
    RTLLM         design_description.txt  INPUT
                  verified_*.v            ORACLE
                  testbench.v             ORACLE
    CVDP          input.prompt/.context   INPUT
                  output.*, harness       ORACLE

§ 4.05 says read only the INPUT. Stated as prose, that is a rule an agent has to
remember — and this repo has measured what happens to rules agents have to
remember (v0.1.25: the in-gate fix held across 17 fresh agents, the same content
as free-text guidance regressed). So the split is a TABLE, and `open_input()`
RAISES on an oracle path. A staging bug becomes an exception instead of a
quietly contaminated number.

    """The answer artefact, in the shape the scorer reads — or a refusal.

    Always step 1's RTL (`phase2/stage1/rtl/*`) — measured: every open RTL
    benchmark's scorer reads RTL and none reads a netlist or a GDS.

    A FILE EXISTING IS NOT AN ANSWER. The first version of this function globbed
    the directory and reported ok=True on anything it found. Measured on a
    6-problem VerilogEval run: 4 of them had `rtl_gen` BLOCKED ("REFUSED TO RUN:
    1 declared input(s) ABSENT") and still carried a 67-byte
    `module chip_top(output out);` skeleton written by a scaffolding step — and
    `--solve` reported **6/6 produced an artefact**. It would have handed four
    empty modules to a scorer and called it success.

    So the run's OWN VERDICT decides. Normally the step that owns this
    artefact must report PASS.  The sole exception is an explicitly supplied
    AI-backup/repair candidate: its re-entry run begins at step 2 so rtl_gen
    must report SKIPPED-BY-ENTRY, while all downstream PROGRAM gates run over
    the hash-bound supplied bytes.  Callers must opt into that exception with
    ``supplied_rtl=True``; an ordinary solve can therefore never promote a
    scaffold merely because its generation step was skipped.

    NOR IS THE WRONG MODULE NAME AN ANSWER. When the benchmark's scorer
    instantiates one fixed top module (``module_name_strategy``), an artefact
    that never declares that module cannot be scored at all: the grading
    testbench fails to elaborate. Callers that know the required name pass it as
    ``required_top`` and this refuses the artefact, with `ok=False`, exactly as
    it refuses a scaffold.

    Refusing HERE is the whole point. The identical check already existed at the
    sample-export step, which is the last step of the run -- far past the point
    where anything could act on it. Measured on a 156-problem VerilogEval-v2
    run: one candidate was emitted as `module chip_top` with correct logic, and
    because the check lived only at export, (a) it was sent for AI review, where
    it CANNOT be failed, since the review contract requires a challenge
    testbench instantiating the missing module and such a testbench cannot
    elaborate, and (b) the all-or-nothing export then blocked the ENTIRE run's
    score. A defect the program can detect deterministically must be detected
    where the flow can still act on it -- here, which routes it to AI backup for
    re-authoring, the correct remedy.

    NOR IS ONE FILE THE DELIVERABLE (vibe-ic#2211). Everything above judges the
    generating STEP or a property of the concatenated text; nothing asked whether
    the complete set COMPILES. Measured on this tree at plugin 1.20.18: emit a
    normalized copy of the RTL back into the deliverable directory and
    `harness_exact_selfverify` returns rc 0 with all three of its gates PASS on
    the file it was handed, while `iverilog` on the resulting set exits 2 --
    "'test_unit' has already been declared in this scope". The per-file harness
    is not at fault; it verified exactly what it was given. The gap was that
    `ok=True` from HERE is what freezes the whole set (`_archive_candidate`) and
    sends it onward. So the exact ordered deliverable manifest is compiled here,
    bound to its own hashes, and a set that cannot compile is refused with the
    compiler's own words.

    # Everything above this line is satisfiable by a bundle that cannot exist.
    # `rtl_gen` reports on the STEP; `required_top` is satisfied by a name
    # declared twice exactly as well as by one declared once; and the per-file
    # harness (`harness_exact_selfverify`) verifies the one file it is handed and
    # is entitled to say so. Measured on this tree, plugin 1.20.18: emit a
    # normalized copy of the RTL back into the deliverable directory and the
    # per-file harness returns rc 0 with all three of its gates PASS, while
    # `iverilog` on the resulting set exits 2 with "'test_unit' has already been
    # declared in this scope". `ok=True` here is what freezes that set
    # (`_archive_candidate`) and sends it to review, so the defect survived to
    # export — which is exactly the argument this function's own docstring
    # already makes about the required-top check.
    #
    # The compiler is the authority and the textual module count is NOT. The
    # sibling rule in `rtl_final_bundle_integrity._module_map` reports duplicate
    # ownership for `ifdef`-guarded alternatives, which are legal and compile
    # clean; only the compile separates those from a real redeclaration. So this
    # calls the SHARED `compile_source_manifest` — one implementation, also used
    # by the export-time `check_final_bundle` — and never a second textual
    # duplicate-module policy.
    #
    # A BLOCKED bundle is refused HERE, where the flow can still act on it: the
    # caller routes an `ok=False` candidate to AI backup for re-authoring, which
    # is the remedy. NOT_MEASURED (no `iverilog`, or a compile that outran its
    # timeout) is NEITHER — the candidate is admitted and the record says the
    # bundle compile was never measured, because a missing tool is not evidence
    # of a clean bundle and must not be reported as one.

    # ONLY for a manifest that already looks wrong, so a well-formed candidate
    # costs nothing and this function stays inspect-only on the path every

    # an `iverilog` call inside the solve path, and
    # `test_public_input_backup_provenance` -- which patches `bd.subprocess.run`,
    # i.e. the subprocess MODULE, and counts worker invocations -- saw 2 where it
