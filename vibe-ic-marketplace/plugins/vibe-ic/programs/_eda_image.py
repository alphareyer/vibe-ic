"""Which vibeic-eda image to run — asked, not remembered.

WHY THIS EXISTS
===============
This plugin used to carry the image version as a literal in eleven places, kept
in step by `tools/vibeic-eda/sync_image_version.py --check` and advanced by a PR
that vibeic-eda's daily release opened on this repo. The stated reason was that
the pinned tag "matches what the plugin was VERIFIED AGAINST".

Measured 2026-08-20: nothing ever verified that. The release established that
the tag was PULLABLE and then wrote the claim anyway, on every publish. The
claim was false the moment it was written, and it cost a cross-repo check-in per
image release — plus a loop where the open anchor PR made the next round's
publish gate non-zero and skipped the public page.

And the claim was never needed. vibeic-eda is built FOR this plugin and sits
under it. Its own release gate already establishes what this layer would have
re-checked: `check_no_capability_lost` proves 78 commands across 17 replaced
prefixes still resolve in the new image, 439 fork self-checks run, every declared
PDK is present with the version shape it promises, and the build refuses unless
sby/yices, ALIGN, klayout and the xyce plugin builder all work. A release that
passes that is usable by construction. A second opinion from up here, with less
evidence, adds nothing.

So: no pinned version, no anchor, no sync tool, no PR. Ask which image is
current and run that.

A GATE JUDGES A DIGEST, NOT A REMEMBERED VERSION
================================================
This module used to answer a THIRD question — `anchor_image()`, "which image does
THIS CHECKOUT name" — read from `tools/vibeic-eda/VERSION`, a file in this repo
holding vibeic-eda's version number. Its purpose was vibe-ic#927's: a gate that
reports FAIL about the image's CONTENTS must not have its verdict moved by a third
party's push.

That file is GONE, and the reason is measured rather than preferred. It cost a PR
in this repo per vibeic-eda release, and what it bought was not protection:

  * MEASURED 2026-08-21 on 8HD-9: the anchor said 0.3.16 and this host's newest
    vibeic-eda image was 0.3.13. `docker run ...:0.3.16` printed "Unable to find
    image locally" and began a multi-gigabyte pull — inside a hygiene gate. The
    anchored gate was not judging an old image safely; it was judging an image the
    machine does not have, at a cost that gets a gate switched off;
  * `sync_image_version.py --check`, the gate that kept the anchor consistent, was
    RED on main for `crosslayer_rewrite_equivalence.py:379` — a comment recording
    which image a measurement was taken on. The coupling was demanding that a
    measurement record be falsified;
  * of 11 registered install docs only ONE still carried an X.Y.Z pin at all. The
    documentation had already decoupled itself.

The property #927 actually needs is REPRODUCIBILITY AND ATTRIBUTION, not
immutability: say exactly WHICH bytes were judged, so the verdict can be re-run and
so a red is attributable to the image rather than to the change under test.

TWO FACTS, ASKED OF THE IMAGE, NEITHER STORED HERE
==================================================
  the DIGEST   `repo@sha256:…` — immutable, and what you replay with;
  the VERSION  the image's own standard `org.opencontainers.image.version`
               label — immediately readable, and what a human says out loud.

The version is READ FROM THE IMAGE and BELIEVED. Nothing here validates its shape
or corrects it: published images today still inherit upstream iic-osic-tools'
value (`2026.06`), and from vibeic-eda 0.3.19 the label carries the fork's own
version. Both are recorded verbatim, and the changeover costs no edit here. A
shape check would be a workaround for one release window and dead code forever
after.

`judged_image()` replaces `anchor_image()` and returns both. It PREFERS THE IMAGE
ALREADY ON THIS HOST — which also removes the one new failure mode a resolved
reference introduces, two gates in one CI run resolving a floating tag at
different minutes and silently judging different images. A local image cannot
move under you. Reaching the registry, which can, is behind an explicit
`allow_pull`.

WHEN THE IMAGE WILL NOT SAY, THAT IS NOT_MEASURED, NOT A VERDICT. A gate that
could not resolve a digest, or could not read the label, exits its own
"cannot check" code with its marker printed. "I could not read it" and "I read it
and it was bad" must never produce the same verdict — see `unidentified_reason`.

`:latest` IS NOT ENOUGH, and this is the part worth keeping
===========================================================
`docker run …:latest` does NOT consult the registry. If the machine already has
something tagged `latest`, that is what runs — however old. The predecessor of
this module records the matching incident from the other direction: it was once
hardcoded to `hpretl/iic-osic-tools:latest`, and on a machine that had only the
fork pulled, `docker run` failed with image-not-found and the whole DFT step
silently died.

So `resolve()` asks the REGISTRY what `latest` means and returns that DIGEST.
A digest cannot be a stale local tag. When the registry cannot be reached the
fallback is the newest vibeic-eda tag actually present locally — and it SAYS SO
on stderr, because a toolchain quietly older than the one the caller believes it
is running is the failure this module exists to prevent.

    ABOUT SILICON — inventing a finding out of an absent toolchain is the one
    direction `test_VACUOUS_no_docker_is_rc2_with_the_marker` exists to forbid.

    THE THIRD QUESTION, and the one vibe-ic#927 asked first. `resolve()` asks the
    registry, so what it returns changes when anyone publishes — right for RUNNING
    a tool, and the reason a gate must not simply call it and report about
    whatever came back without saying what that was.

    The answer here is an IDENTITY, never a remembered version. Order:

      1. an explicit `--image` or `VIBEIC_EDA_IMAGE`/`IIC_EDA_IMAGE` override,
         resolved to its digest — naming an image by hand is the operator's
         deliberate call, and it is still pinned so the report can name it;
      2. the newest vibeic-eda image ALREADY ON THIS HOST, by its digest. No
         network, no pull, and it cannot move between two gates in one CI run;
      3. the registry's current `latest`, ONLY when the caller passes
         `allow_pull`. Handing `docker run` a digest this host does not have
         starts a multi-gigabyte fetch, and a gate that does that silently is a
         gate people switch off (the reasoning
         `input_doc_pdk_claim_vs_installed_pdk_check.start_pinned_container`
         already records, applied to the gates that never got it).

    With none of the three, `ref` is None and `why_not` says what was tried. It
    does NOT fall back to `LEGACY_IMAGE`: upstream iic-osic-tools carries none of
    the forked tools, so a verdict about it is a verdict about the wrong image.
