"""The PAIR. Three runtime identities, reconciled ONCE, before any fan-out.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
======================
`_eda_pin` already answers three separate questions correctly. Nothing asked
all three together, and nothing asked them BEFORE work started.

MEASURED and reported as #2120. Plugin 1.18.68 and the published EDA 0.3.48 each
passed their own checks and did not form a runnable pair:

  * the installed pin required ``sha256:8c5694ab…``;
  * a fresh pull of the published ``:latest`` resolved to ``sha256:1463dac5…``,
    whose own version label ALSO reads ``0.3.48`` — same version, different
    build, different bytes;
  * a newly started MCP process reported ``16/16 checks passed`` against the
    upgraded shared container.

Sixteen tools were present. None of that is a statement about whether the
dispatcher would select that container or accept its digest, and it did not: the
dispatcher launched workers, runner provenance recorded a digest-derived
container that was absent, and the batch had to be stopped and excluded.

A VERSION IS NOT A DIGEST, AND "16/16 TOOLS" IS NOT "EXECUTION-READY"
====================================================================
Those are the two substitutions this module refuses. Tool availability answers
"can this container run yosys"; the pair answers "is this the container the pin
demands". A deployment can be perfect on the first and unrunnable on the second,
and 0.3.48-vs-0.3.48 is precisely the case where a human reading a version
number cannot tell.

THREE CHECKS, IN THIS ORDER, EACH KEEPING ITS OWN CODE
======================================================
  1. ``pinned_image_present``   — THIS host holds the pinned bytes, under the
     configured repository or under any other name it pulled them from: the
     digest is the identity and the repository is configuration (#2170).
                                             refuses ``IMAGE_NOT_PRESENT``
  2. ``default_container_name`` — which container a run would actually select,
     honouring ``VIBEIC_EDA_CONTAINER``, and whether it exists at all.
                                             refuses ``CONTAINER_ABSENT``
  3. ``container_matches_pin``  — that container's image digest IS the pinned
     digest.                                 refuses ``CONTAINER_IMAGE_MISMATCH``

The sub-codes are not decoration. "the image was never pulled", "the container
is gone" and "the container is the wrong build" need three different actions,
and a preflight that collapses them into one word sends the operator to re-run
the thing that cannot work. Which of the three disagreed is recorded by name.

IT IS AN INFRASTRUCTURE VERDICT, NOT A DESIGN ONE
=================================================
`RUNTIME_INFRASTRUCTURE_NOT_READY` is its own class and is returned BEFORE any
per-design work exists. A design that was never attempted has no FAIL to report
and nothing for an AI repair task to repair; charging the machine's state to the
design is how a deployment defect becomes a score.

DIGESTS ONLY IN THE HEALTH LINE
===============================
`pair_line()` names the two digests and the container, and never a repository.
The repository is deployment configuration -- on this fleet a private registry
address -- and an address does not belong in an artefact that gets committed or
published. The VERBATIM refusal, which `_eda_pin` composes with the repository
in it, is preserved in the run record (a run directory, never committed) because
the reporter of a mismatch has to be able to tell a stale container from a
mis-set ``VIBEIC_EDA_IMAGE_REPO``.

chip-AGNOSTIC: image and container identity only. No design, PDK, vendor, IC or
host-address literal appears here.
