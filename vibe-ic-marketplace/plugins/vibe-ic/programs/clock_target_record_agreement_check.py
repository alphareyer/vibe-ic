"""clock_target_record_agreement_check.py — ONE RUN, ONE CLOCK-TARGET ANSWER.

THE DEFECT (measured, vibe-ic#2159, `subservient`, lane rbsub6 on 8HD-9)
========================================================================
Two records of the same run's clock target named DIFFERENT technologies and
DIFFERENT provenance tiers while agreeing on the number::

    reports/phase3/clock_target_provenance.json
        pdk = gf180mcuD   tier = declared_pdk_table   period_ns = 20.0
        cite = input/docs/L9_constraints_floorplan.md:34

    phase1/generated_docs/L19_CONSTRAINTS_PDK.json  fields.clock_target
        pdk = sky130      tier = l8_declared          period_ns = 20.0

The design's own table, in the very file the first record cites, gives
``sky130_fd_sc_hd -> 10 ns`` and ``gf180mcu_* -> 20 ns``.  So "sky130 -> 20 ns"
contradicts its own source: one of the two records had a PDK name attached to a
number that does not belong to it.

That is precisely the failure #2091's provenance exists to prevent.  A reader
who opens L19 and a reader who opens the run record come away with different
beliefs about WHERE the number the backend signed off against came from — and
one of them is reading a technology the run never built against.

THE CONTRACT THIS ENFORCES
==========================
The AUTHORITATIVE record is the one that names the PDK the run ACTUALLY BUILT
AGAINST — the run's own ``clock_target_provenance.json``, written by the
Phase-3 runner from the resolved technology.  #2136 settled the same question
for the area baseline: a technology-bound number belongs to the technology the
run used, never to one named somewhere in the documents.

L19 then either records THE SAME pdk and tier as the run, or records
``NOT_STATED`` — declining to name a technology it cannot bind to the number.
What it must never do is carry another PDK's tier under this PDK's number.
`l19_constraint_token_emit._clock_target_record` is the emitter side of that
rule; this program is the enforcement side, and it refuses by NAME, printing
both records.

WHAT IS COMPARED, AND WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT
==============================================
Compared, when BOTH records name the field:

  * ``pdk``     — different technologies for one run is the #2159 defect.
  * ``tier``    — different provenance for one run: the two readers above.
  * ``period_ns`` — different numbers for one run, which is worse than either.

NOT compared:

  * An L19 record whose status is ``NOT_STATED``.  An explicit absence is the
    contract's other permitted answer, not a disagreement; it is reported as
    such and it PASSES.
  * An L19 record that names no pdk (``pdk`` null / ``pdk_source`` NOT_STATED)
    is not bound to the run's technology, so its TIER is not held against the
    run's.  The record is not claiming to describe the run's build.  This is
    the shape a Phase-1 emission has before Phase 3 has published anything,
    and refusing it would redden every ordinary run for the flow's own
    ordering rather than for anything about the design.

PDK NAME COMPARISON — ONLY AN EXACT NAME IS AGREEMENT.  Two technology names
agree when they are equal ignoring surrounding space and case, and never
otherwise.  A PREFIX RELATION IS NOT AGREEMENT: reading a family name and one
of its variants as the same technology is a GUESS that two names mean the same
thing, and this entire defect is a technology name landing beside a number it
did not own — accepting a prefix is that same error one notch smaller.  The
relation is still COMPUTED and reported in ``pdk_match`` (``family_prefix``
when one name is a prefix of the other, ``different`` otherwise), so a reader
of a refusal can see exactly WHY it refused and how close the two names were.
A merely-close name also stops making the TIER comparable: a record not bound
to this run's technology is refused on the PDK, never quietly compared
tier-to-tier as if it described the same build.

THE COST OF THE STRICT RULE, MEASURED BEFORE IT SHIPPED — membership, not a
count.  Over the run corpus reachable on this fleet (the published corpus at
its `benchmark-data` tree 3e16f0c7ef, plus a fleet-wide sweep for the run
record): 106 roots publish EITHER record, ZERO publish BOTH, and so ZERO roots
change verdict under this rule.  The zero carries its own reason rather than
standing as a sweep — nothing in the corpus is judgeable by EITHER rule, because
the #2091 provenance machinery post-dates every published run tree, and the one
run record found off-corpus is an archived reports directory with no L19 beside
it.  THE INSTRUMENT WAS VALIDATED ON A KNOWN ANSWER FIRST: a planted root whose
two records are a family and its variant reports PASS under the old rule and
FAIL under this one and lands in the delta, while planted equal-name and
different-family roots stay out of it.  A census that cannot report a non-empty
delta is not a census.

ABSENT VERSUS UNREADABLE, AND WHY THEY GET DIFFERENT VERDICTS
=============================================================
A run that publishes no run record, or whose L19 carries no clock-target
record at all, has made no second claim that could contradict a first one.
There is nothing here to be wrong about, so the honest verdict is
NOT_APPLICABLE (rc 0) — the same self-reported applicability
`sta_corner_record_completeness_check` uses for a run that declares no corner.
Reporting NOT CHECKED there would block every Phase-3-only and analog run for
the shape of the project rather than for anything about the design.

A record that EXISTS and cannot be parsed is the other case entirely: its
subject is present and this gate could not read it.  That is NOT CHECKED
(rc 2) — "could not read it" is never "read it and it agreed", and absence of
a READABLE input is not a pass (vibe-ic#1140).

EXIT CODES
==========
  0  PASS           — the two records agree, or L19 records an explicit
                      absence, or L19 names no technology and so claims
                      nothing about it.
  0  NOT_APPLICABLE — one of the two records is not published by this run.
  1  FAIL           — the two records disagree; the reason names both.
  2  NOT CHECKED    — a record exists on disk and could not be read.

STEP 23 ON THE TOOL (F15)
=========================
When step 23 runs `librelane` or `dual`, the period the design was SIGNED OFF
against is the one STAPostPNR timed, and that is a third record of the same
answer: each corner's `clock.rpt` (`Clock: <name>` / `Period: <p>`, in the
unit the corner's own report states as `STA_TIME_UNIT`) is read through
`librelane_signoff.step23_tool_arm`, bound to the sha256 the tool wrote. The
run record's `period_ns` must be the period of a clock the tool timed, at
every corner; otherwise FAIL, naming the corner. A corner whose clock report
or time unit cannot be read REFUSES (rc 1), never NOT_APPLICABLE.

Chip / PDK-AGNOSTIC: no chip, vendor, PDK or library literal appears here.
Every name compared comes from the run's own records.
