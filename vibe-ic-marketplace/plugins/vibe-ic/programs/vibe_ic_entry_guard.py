"""vibe_ic_entry_guard.py — enforce single entry point for benchmark + IC runs.

Doctrine (owner directive 2026-06-28, BINDING):

    A benchmark / IC-design number is meaningful ONLY if it measures what the
    Vibe-IC deterministic runner chain can produce.  Therefore every run MUST
    enter through the Vibe-IC plugin's Phase-1 path; direct-agent authoring or
    patching followed by a host-scorer invocation measures "Opus + MCP-EDA",
    not Vibe-IC.

Canonical single entry point:

    python3 vibe_ic_one_shot_runner.py <project>

That orchestrator already integrates phase1_one_shot_runner.py (which in turn
invokes phase1_engine.cli), then phase2 / analog / phase3.

This guard accepts any of the following as evidence that the run went through
the Vibe-IC runner:

  - reports/orchestrator/vibe_ic_one_shot.json   (full orchestrator report)
  - reports/orchestrator/phase1_one_shot.json    (phase1 standalone runner)
  - reports/phase1_one_shot.json                 (legacy phase1 location)
  - phase1/generated_docs/L1_DATASHEET.json      (phase1 engine output)
  - work/<design>/reports/orchestrator/vibe_ic_one_shot.json (Shape-B run)
  - work/<design>/phase1/generated_docs/L*.json  (Shape-B fact graph)

Trust boundary: this is a cooperative workflow/evidence-integrity gate, not a
cryptographic or OS-principal attestation service.  It rejects missing,
malformed, stale-taxonomy, or structurally impossible runner records.  Code
already executing as the same uid can reconstruct local files and is outside
this gate's authority; claiming protection against that caller would require a
separate principal or signing service.  Score reports must not describe this
check as proof against a malicious same-uid author.

A run dir that lacks all of these is rejected unless the caller explicitly
passes --allow-direct-agent (which still emits a mandatory disclosure).

Usage:
    python3 vibe_ic_entry_guard.py <project|run_dir> [--strict]
    python3 vibe_ic_entry_guard.py <project|run_dir> --allow-direct-agent

Exit codes:
    0  entry-point evidence found (or --allow-direct-agent warn issued)
    1  no evidence (only under --strict; default is warn + rc=0 for back-compat)

Verdict mode: ``--strict`` is BLOCKING; the default and the explicit
``--allow-direct-agent`` compatibility path are ADVISORY and disclose the
missing evidence on stderr/stdout respectively.

# `programs/` is a flat directory whose modules import each other by BARE
# name. Python puts a file's own directory on `sys.path` only when that file
# is run as `__main__`; under `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location` — how
# the gates, the wiring audit and much of the suite load a program — it does
# not, so every bare sibling import below raises ModuleNotFoundError. Measured
# on the base tree: 454 of the 1385 top-level programs died that way. Restore
# the condition the file is written for. Idempotent, and the same shape the
# sibling programs that already carry it use.
