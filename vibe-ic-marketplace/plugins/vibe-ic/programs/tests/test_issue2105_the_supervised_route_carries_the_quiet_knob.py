"""vibe-ic#2105 — the SUPERVISED exec route must carry the image's quiet knob.

THE DEFECT, AT THE CONSUMER.  v1.18.43 (854d30295) moved
`phase3_one_shot_runner._docker_exec`'s supervised branch onto the shared
`_docker_watchdog.run_docker_supervised`, but the route seam `_exec_argv` did
not travel with it: the shared path builds its own argv and passes no `opts`.
So from that landing every LONG tool run — the `marker=` sites: PnR, route, CTS,
klayout DRC, magic ext2spice, netgen LVS — stopped carrying
`-e IIC_OSIC_TOOLS_QUIET=1`, and the vibeic-eda image's login profile printed

    [INFO] Final PATH variable: ...
    [INFO] Final PYTHONPATH variable: ...

to STDOUT ahead of the tool's own output.  MEASURED on the pinned image, one
container, same command, only the program blobs differing: base 3 stdout lines
of which 2 are banner, fix 1 line.  That is the defect #211 fixed for a single
consumer and the seam was built to close at source for all of them; the SHORT
probes (`_docker_exec_raw`) kept the knob the whole time, which is why no
existing test noticed — every banner test drives the raw entry point only.

WHY THIS TEST STARTS ITS OWN CONTAINER.  The property is about what a real
login shell prints, so a real container is the subject.  It is started HERE,
from the pinned digest, under a name this file owns, and removed by the id it
recorded — never a container this host happened to have, whose image is not
ours to assume and whose bytes are not ours to trust.  When the engine or the
pinned image is unreachable the test SKIPS WITH THE REASON NAMED; it never
assumes the host and never reports a green it did not measure.

THE MUTATION IT IS REQUIRED TO KILL: taking the supervised dispatch off the
seam (dropping `exec_argv=_exec_argv` in `_docker_exec`, or the `exec_argv`
branch in `run_docker_supervised`) must bring the two banner lines back.
