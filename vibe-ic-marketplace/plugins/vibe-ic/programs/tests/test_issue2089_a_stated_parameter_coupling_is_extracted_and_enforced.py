"""The input said "when you set X, also set Y". Only X reached the build.

MEASURED DEFECT (vibe-ic#2089, lane icaes, opentitan_aes)
=========================================================
`L8_RTL_CONSTANTS.parameters[override=true]` carries every value the design
input STATES, and `design_one_shot_runner._apply_l8_param_overrides` applies
them to the auto-emitted chip_top. Neither carries what setting one OBLIGES.

The reproduction input states a masking parameter off and, in its own words
one paragraph later:

    "When disabling the masking, also an unmasked S-Box implementation needs
     to be selected using the corresponding compile-time Verilog parameter."

Only the first half reached L8. The wrapper applied ``SecMasking = 0`` alone,
the coupled S-Box parameter kept its vendor default, that default names a
variant the cell EXCLUDES from staging, and yosys aborted with
``Module `\\aes_sbox_dom' referenced ... is not part of the design``. The abort
was triaged as a synthesis failure and, one step on, as a ZERO denominator —
eight testbenches "errored at elaboration", which is not a functional result
at all.

This is not an implicit convention read into the document. The sentence states
it outright, and an independent reader of ONLY the design input derived the
same coupling without seeing the crash.

WHAT IS PINNED HERE, AND THE LINE IT MUST NOT CROSS
===================================================
Two properties, one per program:

  * PHASE 1 extracts the RELATION and the sentence — never a value. The
    grammar is small ("when <disabling|…> <TRIGGER>, … also … <OBLIGATION>")
    and the sentence must SAY it is about a parameter; that grounding is the
    mechanism, so it is what these tests pin. A sentence that DENIES the
    coupling is dropped (vibe-ic#712), because publishing a denied
    requirement is the failure that vocabulary exists to prevent.

  * THE EMITTER REFUSES, and does not choose. #586's refusal — "Choosing a
    different PRESENT variant would silently rewrite a parameter selection
    and is NOT done" — is untouched: the outcome is a refusal naming both
    parameters and quoting the input's own sentence, so the operator supplies
    the missing declaration. Nothing here proposes a value.

BOTH DIRECTIONS. A design whose input carries no coupling sentence must be
unchanged, and an input that states BOTH halves must pass — otherwise this is
a check that always fires, which is not a check.
