"""The deck-density extractors read deck CODE, never the sentences a rule block
carries — and the `_NOT_PROSE` exemption that states so is measured, not argued.

WHAT THE RATCHET FOUND. `metal_fill_config_gen::density_rule_layer_identifiers`
shipped reading the RAW rule block: a `re.findall` for `<layer>.area` over text
that also contains the `# Rule <id>:` header, the `##` notes beside it, and the
human-readable violation message the rule prints. That is the #706/#711 shape —
a value taken out of a sentence and written as a declaration, with nothing
asking whether the sentence DENIES it — and `prose_polarity_consulted_check
--ratchet` refused the landing by name.

THE FIX REMOVES THE REFERENT rather than arguing about it: every input now goes
through `die_level_deck_rule_attribution.deck_code_only`, which blanks every
quoted string and every `#` comment in ONE left-to-right scan that tracks both
states together, keeping offsets so the deck's own line structure — which the
section-banner block boundary is computed from — is unchanged. After it, no
sentence reaches any regex, so the polarity question has no referent, and the
claim is a `_NOT_PROSE` entry rather than a debt-register entry.

BOTH DIRECTIONS, ON THE SAME 84 TRIALS:
  * all 21 tokens of `_prose_polarity`'s own denial vocabulary — both tiers,
    the five CJK spellings included — each carrying a DECLARATION-SHAPED
    payload, in each of the 4 positions a sentence can physically occupy here,
    move 0 of 84 published answers;
  * NEGATIVE CONTROL: the identical payload spliced in as CODE moves it, so the
    fixture could have moved;
  * MUTATION: with `deck_code_only` replaced by the identity — the strip
    deleted — the same 84 trials move 84 of 84.
And the EXEMPTION's own control: the function is still what the scanner flags,
and with the entry removed the ratchet refuses again.
