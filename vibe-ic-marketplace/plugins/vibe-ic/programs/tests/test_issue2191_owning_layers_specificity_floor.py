"""test_issue2191_owning_layers_specificity_floor.py

An OWNERSHIP answer is read over the layer's CONTENT, and it needs a token
that can tell one layer from another (vibe-ic#2191).

WHAT WAS MEASURED
-----------------
`owning_layers` answered "which layers carry this fact" over the WHOLE emitted
document, with no floor on how specific the tokens had to be. The finding
built on that answer (`RULE_AI_MISSCOPED`) says, in as many words:

    ... and ['L19_...', 'L20_DFT_SCAN_TOPOLOGY', ...] DOES -- every one of the
    1 expected token(s). So the fact was extracted and the expectation named
    the wrong layer; this is NOT a missing extraction and must not be repaired
    in an extractor.

That directive is the load-bearing part, and it was reachable on evidence that
says nothing about the design. REPRODUCED on the live tip (lane cz2191, host
8HD-4, 2026-09-08) against a Phase-1 root of 28 emitted documents:

    owning_layers(root, ['crypto_accelerator'])
      -> L19_CONSTRAINTS_PDK L20_DFT_SCAN_TOPOLOGY L21_POWER_INTENT
         L22_VERIFICATION_PLAN L23_SECURITY_REQUIREMENTS L24_SIGNOFF
         L25_RELIABILITY_MISSION_PROFILE L26_MECHANICAL_TRANSDUCTION
         L27_MEMORY_MODULE_SPD

`L20_DFT_SCAN_TOPOLOGY` contains exactly one occurrence of that token and it is
the document's own `ic_class` stamp -- a whole field value, no surrounding
prose. L20 states nothing about the fact the expectation asked for. The same
run had `L6_CONTROL_LOGIC` OWN the token `GHASH`, its only two matches being
the SOURCE FILENAMES the emitter recorded under `extraction_evidence`.

Measured over 482 distinct Phase-1 roots (13,496 L documents) found on that
host, sampling 9,600 tokens from 120 of them:

  * 58.3% of every (layer, token) ownership relation was carried ONLY by the
    emitter's envelope -- the document's identity, its classification stamp,
    its provenance, the hints it gives an extractor, the paths of the files it
    read. Not by anything the layer states.
  * 323 of the 9,600 tokens were carried by EVERY layer of their root, and
    each of them could assert ownership. A rule that matches everything
    decides nothing. After the guards below, ZERO tokens are.
  * of 489 distinct (root, `ic_class` value) pairs, 452 (92.4%) own no layer
    at all once the envelope is out; the 37 that remain are roots whose
    CONTENT genuinely names the class, and they keep owning.
  * the widest single offender is the emitter's own version strings: the bare
    token `1` was carried by all 28 layers of the reproduction root, and in 21
    of them by the ENVELOPE ALONE -- `_generator.plugin_version` ("1.9.62"), a
    `schema_version` / `emitted_by` version suffix, or an
    `extraction_strategy` gate key. Seven carry it in content.

TWO GUARDS, deliberately INDEPENDENT, and a third state
-------------------------------------------------------
  * the haystack is `_ownership_units` -- the document minus the envelope it
    is wrapped in. `met` is untouched and is still decided over the whole
    document, so no verdict moves here and a moved verdict can never be
    attributed to this landing.
  * a token more of the searched layers carry than not is refused, and an
    expectation with no discriminating token at all gets its ownership
    question REFUSED rather than answered.
  * the refusal is a STATUS, never an empty list. `owning_layers: []` already
    means "no layer carries this fact" and the consumer publishes it as a
    finding about the DESIGN; answering a question nobody could ask with a
    design gap is the substitution this whole track exists to prevent. The
    row goes out under `RULE_AI_OWNERSHIP_UNDECIDABLE`, `about: "track"`.

Every test here is PAIRED, in the manner of the sibling #2127 and #312 files:
the refusal case is matched by an acceptance case, so a guard that always
fired would fail as loudly as one that never fired.

Every fixture is synthesised here from neutral parts. No design, PDK, vendor
or IP-model identifier appears anywhere in this file.
