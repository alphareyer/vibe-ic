"""An environment refusal at A3 reaches the step table as itself, and the
steps below it name A3 rather than an absence they did not cause
(vibe-ic#2088).

MEASURED, END TO END, 2026-09-07 on 8HD-9 against 94617408759e, one real
project, one real `analog_one_shot_runner` invocation per arm, with the host's
`vibeic-eda` container holding sha256:06537f7e… (0.3.46) against a pin of
sha256:8c5694ab… (0.3.48). Rows for the block whose netlist A3 could not
produce:

  PRISTINE MAIN
    WAIVED  A3_netlist_gen       deterministic producer ERRORED rc=1 and wrote
                                 NO gap file — this is not an honest gap: …
    FAIL    A4_corner_sweep      A4_SHA_SOURCE_UNREADABLE: netlist_source=
                                 'phase3/analog/ldo/ldo.sp' … cannot be read now
    PASS    A5_layout            MATCHING: 1 did not say (ldo)
    PASS    A6_block_pv          MATCHING: 1 did not say (ldo)
    PASS    A7_post_layout_resim PASS — 1/1 block(s) clean

  WITH THIS COMMIT, same command, same container
    BLOCKED A3_netlist_gen       ENV_REFUSED: analog_a3_netlist_emit:
                                 CONTAINER_IMAGE_MISMATCH: container vibeic-eda
                                 runs sha256:06537f7e…, but the pinned runtime
                                 is …@sha256:8c5694ab…
    BLOCKED A4_corner_sweep      upstream A3_netlist_gen refused: <that line>
    BLOCKED A5_layout            upstream A3_netlist_gen refused: <that line>
    BLOCKED A6_block_pv          upstream A3_netlist_gen refused: <that line>
    BLOCKED A7_post_layout_resim upstream A3_netlist_gen refused: <that line>

THE THREE PASSES ARE THE POINT. A5, A6 and A7 reported PASS for a block whose
netlist was never produced, on a run where the cause was one line the producer
had already printed. `WAIVED` reads "not produced yet, invoke the skill" — and
no skill can supply a container running the pinned image, so the advice could
not be acted on either.

THE MEASURED ROW ALSO CORRECTS THE ISSUE'S OWN TEXT. #2088 reports the WAIVED
detail ending in a bare dash with nothing after it; at this base the tail
carries the traceback's last line, which does name the mismatch. What is
missing at THIS tip is not the text but the TIER: a host condition recorded as
a producer defect, and four downstream verdicts about the design.

The tests below drive the runner's own `step_for_block`. Only the A3
producer's ANSWER is supplied; the gate, the dispatch and every downstream step
are the shipped code.
