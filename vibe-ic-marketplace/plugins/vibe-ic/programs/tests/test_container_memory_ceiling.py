"""Every `docker run` this plugin issues must carry a memory ceiling.

MEASURED 2026-08-19 across a seven-machine fleet: 45 EDA containers were
running with `HostConfig.Memory == 0`. A container with no cgroup limit does
not share the host's memory — it IS the host's memory — and `ulimit -v` inside
our image is `unlimited`, so a tool never gets an allocation failure it could
report. On two of those machines a yosys took the whole box: the kernel's OOM
report shows two siblings at 54 GB apiece, then 109 GB for the survivor once
its twin was killed and the room freed. What actually died was chrome and Xorg
— the desktop session — because the OOM killer picks by oom_score_adj, not by
who caused the pressure.

Proven on the shipped image before any of this was written:

    --memory 512m   -> killed at 448 MiB, host `available` unchanged
    no --memory     -> the identical allocation reached 4096 MiB and exited 0

so the ceiling is what makes the difference, not the allocator.

The load-bearing test in this file is `test_no_docker_run_escapes_the_ceiling`.
The others check the arithmetic; that one checks that the arithmetic is
actually reachable from every place a container is created, which is the half
that decays — a new `docker run` added six months from now inherits nothing
unless something refuses it.

# host: three containers, one ngspice apiece at ~25 GB, each correctly under
# its own 88 GB ceiling. 38 MB available, swap 100 % full, load 220. Every TCP
# port still answered its handshake, so every liveness probe read the host as
# healthy while no userspace process could reply, for forty minutes.
#
# The module's own docstring had already named this case and deferred it on
# purpose. These tests hold the line it drew: the arithmetic exists, and the
# DEFAULT does not change.
