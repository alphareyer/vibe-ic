"""The Phase-3 runner must reach its tools when there is no docker client.

WHAT THIS FILE PINS, AND WHY IT EXISTS.  Every Phase-3 step reaches its tool
through `docker exec <$EDA_CONTAINER> bash -lc ...` into a container the runner
never starts.  That is correct beside the image and unreachable INSIDE it:
there is no `docker` binary in there.  MEASURED 2026-09-06, subservient through
the canonical front door (`vibe_ic_one_shot_runner.py --pdk gf180mcuD`) inside
ghcr.io/vibeic/vibeic-eda 0.3.46 — phase1 PASS, phase2 PASS_WITH_WAIVERS, and
Phase 3 died at its first act:

    FAIL synth rc=127 COMMAND_NOT_FOUND: [Errno 2] ... 'docker'

with `yosys` at /foss/tools/bin/yosys in that same process.  Every other
Phase-3 FAIL/BLOCKED in that run descended from it.

THE MUTATIONS EACH TEST IS REQUIRED TO KILL, named here because a control that
cannot fail is not a control:

  * Deleting the LOCAL branch of `_exec_argv` (back to the unconditional
    ["docker", "exec", ...]) must fail `test_local_route_when_no_docker_client`
    and `test_a_command_actually_runs_without_a_docker_client`.
  * Deleting the CONTAINER branch — i.e. always running locally — must fail
    `test_container_route_is_byte_identical_when_docker_exists`, which is the
    guarantee that no host beside a container changes behaviour.
  * Restoring the FIRST, WRONG predicate `not os.environ.get("EDA_CONTAINER")
    and shutil.which("docker") is None` must fail
    `test_a_default_container_name_is_not_an_operator_choice`.  That predicate
    was measured DEAD before it shipped: `phase3_one_shot_runner`'s own
    `--container` defaults to "vibeic-eda" and `main()` exports it
    unconditionally, so `$EDA_CONTAINER` is always set by the time a step runs.
  * Making the local route silent (dropping the stderr announcement or the
    `exec_route` ledger field) must fail `test_the_route_is_announced` and
    `test_the_ledger_records_which_route_ran`.

    AND STAGE WHAT THE NAMED CONTAINER HOLDS (vibe-ic#2100).  `_exec_argv`'s
    container branch builds its argv through `_container_exec.docker_exec_argv`,
    which asks `_eda_pin.container_attach_refusal` whether the container running
    under that NAME holds the pinned bytes, and RAISES `ContainerImageMismatch`
    when it provably does not.  That question is answered by the real docker
    daemon on the machine the test happens to run on.

    MEASURED 2026-09-07 on 8HD-4, both env arms, on pristine main: a container
    literally named `vibeic-eda` — another lane's, holding
    `sha256:06537f7e…` (0.3.46) — was running on the host, so
    `test_container_route_is_byte_identical_when_docker_exists` raised
    CONTAINER_IMAGE_MISMATCH instead of comparing an argv.  The test was
    reporting a fact about `docker ps`, and it would equally have reported
    green-for-the-wrong-reason on a host where nothing was called that.

    `pin_state` therefore STATES what the container holds, by default MATCH —
    "this run's container is the pinned one" — which is the premise every argv
    assertion in this file already relies on and none of them used to say.
    Passing MISMATCH drives the other direction; the guard's own contract is
    pinned by `test_the_container_route_refuses_a_container_holding_other_bytes`
