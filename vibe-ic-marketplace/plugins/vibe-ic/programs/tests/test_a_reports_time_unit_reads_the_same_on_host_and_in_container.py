"""A report's time unit must resolve the same wherever the audit runs, and a
deck's stamp must never vanish in silence.

MEASURED on spm run23, after the 2026-09-24 phase-3 re-run. The post-route
report carried its numbers in plain sight —

    worst slack max 15.20
    tns max 0.00
    worst slack min 0.55

— and `reports/phase3/sta/post_route_summary.json` published NONE of them:

    slack_measurement      "NOT_MEASURED"
    slack_values_in_ns     []
    slack_time_unit_basis  "the report names liberty
                            gf180mcu_fd_sc_mcu7t5v0__ff_n40C_5v50.lib and it
                            could not be read (FileNotFoundError); and the
                            report states no time unit of its own, so no number
                            is published under an _ns name"

`ic_release_docs_gen` then refused the whole release with STA_NO_SLACK.

TWO INDEPENDENT CAUSES, and the unit needs only one of them to survive:

  (1) THE PATH. An STA deck runs INSIDE the EDA image and stamps
      `STA_BASIS_LIBERTY: /foss/pdks/...`, a CONTAINER path. The phase-3 runner
      calls this audit on the HOST, where `/foss/pdks` does not exist. Same
      bytes, same report, different answer depending on who asked.

  (2) THE STAMP. The decks wrote the unit as
      `catch {puts $f "STA_TIME_UNIT: [sta::unit_scale_abbreviation time]..."}`.
      A failed command substitution inside `puts` fails the whole `puts`, and
      `catch` then swallows it, leaving NOTHING — indistinguishable from a deck
      that was never asked. MEASURED across run23's own reports: three carry the
      stamp and `sta_spef_based.rpt` — the one the canonical
      `post_route_timing.rpt` aliases — carries none, from the identical idiom.

A unit that genuinely cannot be established still stays NOT_MEASURED, BY NAME.
That is not what was broken; publishing nothing while the numbers sat in the
file is.
