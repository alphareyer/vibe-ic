"""test_corner_admission_inspect_template_is_one_docker_accepts.py — the
admission probe's `docker inspect` format must be a template Docker PARSES
(lane icadc, 2026-09-15).

THE DEFECT, MEASURED against the live daemon while an A4 corner was running:

    docker inspect -f '{{.Id}}\\t{{.HostConfig.Memory}}\\t{{index .Config.Labels \\"vibeic.corner.token\\"}}' <id>
    rc=64   template parsing error: template: :1: unexpected "\\\\" in operand

The format was built in Python as `"...\\\\t...\\\\\\"vibeic.corner.token\\\\\\""`, so LITERAL
backslashes reached Docker — `\\t` as two characters, `\\"` around the label
key. The argv goes to execve, not to a shell, so nothing ever unescapes them.

WHY IT SURVIVED, AND WHY IT IS WORSE THAN IT LOOKS. `docker_active_reservations`
returns `{}` EARLY when `docker ps` lists no ids, so the broken template is
never reached when nothing is running: it is healthy at the start of every
sweep and refuses from the moment the first corner is alive. In
`_run_pvt_corners` that `AdmissionRefused` is charged to EVERY pooled corner as
`RAM_ADMISSION_REFUSED` — which is exactly the `corners_executed 1/9` /
`A4_PVT_SWEEP_NOT_MEASURED` three tests have been red on main with, and it
breaks REAL sweeps on real hosts, not only fixtures.

AND THE OLD TEST PINNED THE BUG. `test_issue2236_aggregate_ram_admission`
asserted the exact broken string — the MECHANISM — rather than the property
"a template Docker accepts". It was written from the source instead of from
what Docker does with it, which is why nothing caught this.

BOTH DIRECTIONS. The template must parse; and every refusal the probe is
supposed to make on a malformed answer must still fire.

No chip / SKU / foundry literal.
