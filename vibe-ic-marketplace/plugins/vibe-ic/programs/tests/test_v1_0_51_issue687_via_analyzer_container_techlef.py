"""Regression tests for issue #687 — the via-analyzer must read the tech LEF
through the container-aware reader, not a host-only Path.read_text().

Root cause (caravel round-6, public tree v1.0.47): step_pnr did
`tlef_text = Path(pdk.tech_lef).read_text(errors="ignore")` on the HOST, but
`pdk.tech_lef` is a CONTAINER-side path (PDKS_IN_CONTAINER=/foss/pdks); the
iic-osic-tools PDK exists only inside docker (`ls /foss` on host → No such
file). The host read threw FileNotFoundError, was swallowed by the bare
except, and the single-cut-via routing restriction was silently dropped on
the exact PDK class it was written for (multi-cut-only upper vias → DRT-0234
detailed_route abort).

Fix: use `_v1_6_604_read_text_or_container_cat(str(pdk.tech_lef), container)`
— the same host→container-cat fallback every other techlef/liberty consumer
uses — and raise FileNotFoundError only when BOTH fail.

§4.05 negative (no false alert): a benign all-single-cut techlef (sky130-
style) must still produce NO routing restriction — covered by
test_negative_single_cut_pdk_emits_no_restriction.

def test_container_cat_fallback_reads_container_only_techlef(monkeypatch):
    """Simulate a /foss/pdks container-only path: the host read fails, but a
    stubbed `docker exec cat` returns the techlef. The reader the via-
    analyzer now calls must return that content (the old host-only read
    would have returned nothing → analyzer silently skipped).

    THE STUB DESCRIBES THE MODEL THE READER HAS, AND IT NEVER RAISES —
    vibe-ic#2130. This stub replaced the SHARED `subprocess.run` and ASSERTED
    that the argv was the one call it knew about. The reader has since grown a
    SECOND docker call AHEAD of that one: `_container_exec.docker_exec_argv`
    makes the pin/attach check, which shells out `docker inspect` through
    `_eda_pin._docker`. MEASURED 2026-09-07 on 8hd-3, the stub intercepted
    ``['docker', 'inspect', '--format', '{{.Image}}\\t{{.Config.Image}}']``
    first, its assertion fired, `_eda_pin._docker` catches only
    `(OSError, SubprocessError)` so the AssertionError travelled up, and the
    reader's own blanket `except Exception: pass` SWALLOWED THE TEST'S OWN
    FAILURE and returned None — "assert None == '…VIA VIA12 DEFAULT…'", on a
    reader that is working.

    So nothing is asserted INSIDE the stub any more. Every call is RECORDED and
    answered: the attach check is answered truthfully for a container that does
    not exist (there is no `vibeic-test` on any host and there is not meant to
    be — this is a no-container unit test, and that name is a deliberate fiction
    rather than a stale pin literal), the `cat` is answered with the techlef, and
    ANY OTHER route is recorded as undeclared and refused with a non-zero rc.
    The verdict is then taken OUTSIDE the reader, where no `except` of the
    program's can convert it into a None.
