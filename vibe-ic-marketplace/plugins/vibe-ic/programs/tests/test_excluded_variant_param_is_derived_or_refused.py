"""A wrapper default selected a variant the design had deliberately removed.

MEASURED DEFECT
===============
`_autoemit_chip_top_wrapper` copies the DUT's ``#(parameter ...)`` header
verbatim. A security-hardened IP ships several implementation variants of one
block behind a compile-time parameter, and a staging convention may EXCLUDE one
by renaming its file ``<module>.sv.unused-<why>-excluded`` so no RTL glob picks
it up. When the copied default names exactly that variant, the wrapper cannot
elaborate at all — and the flow discovered it several steps later as a raw

    ERROR: Module `\\aes_sbox_dom' referenced in module
    `$paramod\\aes_sbox\\SecSBoxImpl=...' ... is not part of the design

which reads as a synthesis failure and was triaged as one. One unset parameter,
five red steps (l10_unit_tb_run, step4_functional_evidence, yosys_synth,
verilator_coverage, reference_tb) and a BLOCKED dft_lec_chain.

THE LINE THIS MUST NOT CROSS
============================
#586 refuses to pick a variant for the operator, and that refusal survives: a
FREE CHOICE must be DECLARED. The emitter resolves ONLY when the design input
declared something that decides it, and the value is then derived from the
RTL's OWN guard structure — never invented. In every other case it REFUSES BY
NAME, at emission, before a tool is started.

Both directions are pinned below, plus the two controls that must be NO-OPS
byte for byte, plus the two mutations that must re-redden.

# The marker's meaning comes from the NAMING CONVENTION, not from the English
# inside it: `foo.sv.unused-not-excluded-at-all-excluded` is still a file the
# operator moved out of the staged tree, and a flow that read the `not` and then
# IGNORED the marker would stage a variant the operator had deliberately
# removed — the exact failure this whole mechanism exists to prevent, arrived at
# by "consulting polarity". So both directions are pinned: the vocabulary is
# inert in the slot, AND the marker still fires when the slot denies it.
