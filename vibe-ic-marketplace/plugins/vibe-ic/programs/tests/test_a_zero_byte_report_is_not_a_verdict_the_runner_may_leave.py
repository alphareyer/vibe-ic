"""H2 — the runner must write a real antenna report or none, never an empty one.

THE DEFECT, MEASURED (lane czspmfp2, spm).  The PnR Tcl runs
`check_antennas -report_violating_nets -report_file $_ant_rf` once per
iteration. OpenROAD CREATES that file and writes ZERO BYTES when nothing
violates, so a converged iteration leaves a report that exists and says nothing:
`phase3/stage3/pnr/antenna_iter_0.rpt` and `_1.rpt` were both 0 bytes on a run
whose antenna sequence converged `[1, 0]`. `eda_report_audit` discovers them,
judges them, and writes four ERROR findings; since v1.17.103 a verdict over a
report holding no bytes is NOT_MEASURED, so those two unreadable files cost spm
its `Checker.KLayoutAntenna` row outright.

A 0-byte report is the ONE state a consumer cannot read as either "clean" or
"absent" — the two answers it is entitled to. Absent is legitimate and readable.

MUTATIONS THESE MUST KILL:
  * Deleting the `_vic_ant_rm_empty` proc, or any of its three call sites, fails
    `test_the_cleanup_is_defined_and_called_on_every_path`.
  * Widening the guard to delete a NON-empty report (dropping `file size == 0`)
    fails `test_only_an_empty_report_is_removed` — that is the control: a run
    WITH antenna violations must still write and KEEP its report.

# vibe-ic#2157 — THE ASSERTIONS ABOVE READ THE SOURCE. THESE DRIVE THE RUN.
#
# Every test above this line greps `phase3_one_shot_runner.py` for the SPELLING
# of the fix.  MEASURED (vibe-ic#2157, lane rbsub6 on 8HD-9, run tree
# `~/_lane_rbsub6/d/subservient`): with `8000bb196` an ancestor of the run,
# `phase3/stage3/pnr/antenna_iter_0.rpt` and `_1.rpt` were BOTH 0 bytes in the
# published tree, `antenna_report_check` returned rc 1 with verdict
# NOT_MEASURED, and not one assertion above could see it — they were all green
# on the very tree that carried the escape.  A test that can only see the
# spelling of a fix, never its effect, is not a guard on the fix.
#
# So: drive the PRODUCER and assert on the ARTEFACT.
#   * `_antenna_repair_tcl` is the producer of the Tcl.  Its output is executed
#     under a real `tclsh` with the three tool commands stubbed to the MEASURED
#     OpenROAD behaviour (`check_antennas -report_file F` creates F and writes
#     zero bytes), and the assertion is on the DIRECTORY afterwards.
#   * `_drop_empty_antenna_reports` is the producer-side sweep.  It is driven
#     against the exact shape rbsub6 published, and the assertion is that both
#     files are gone BY NAME while every other report in the directory stays.
#   * The mutation arm is executed here, in-test: strip the cleanup call the
#     run actually exercises and the two 0-byte files come back.  Without that
#     arm the artefact assertion could be passing for a reason that has nothing
#     to do with the cleanup.
