"""The phase-3 synth/PnR/GDS cache must be keyed on the RECIPE, not only on
the design inputs — EXECUTABLE, end-to-end through ``main()``.

THE DEFECT
==========
Every pre-existing key on this cache asks "did the INPUT change?":

  * ``_netlist_matches_liberty``                       — the PDK  (PR-A3)
  * ``_stale_rtl_by_fingerprint`` / ``_stale_rtl_vs_netlist``
                                                       — the RTL  (#289/#349)
  * ``_pnr_cache_valid_for``                           — the die  (#593/#596)

Not one of them asks "did the RECIPE change?". So a landed fix to the synth /
PnR / stream-out recipe is a SILENT NO-OP on any tree that already holds an
artefact: the flow reuses what the OLD code produced and reports PASS for code
that never ran. "We landed the fix, re-run to confirm" becomes structurally
unable to confirm anything.

MEASURED, three independent times in one convergence round:
  * a landed tie-cell fix left two steps failing with the exact message it was
    written to eliminate, until the netlist was moved aside BY HAND;
  * three staged files had to be deleted by hand before fixed emitters ran;
  * "netlist already present ... (skipped re-run to preserve provenance)" was
    followed by PnR reading the PREVIOUS DAY's DEF.

THE MUTATION THESE TESTS CATCH
==============================
Deleting any one of the three ``_producer_cache_valid_for`` call sites in
``main()`` — the #755 "fixed one site is not fixed the class" shape. Each of
the three producing steps has its own test below, so removing the key from any
one of them fails a named test rather than being absorbed by the other two.

A source-string test alone would not catch this: a permanently-True
``_prod_ok`` satisfies "the helper is mentioned in main()". These tests DRIVE
``main()`` and observe whether the step was actually invoked.

    The fourth site is `phase3_one_shot_runner.py:47353`,
    `_write_producer_identity(_pl.pnr_dir(project), "pnr")`, added by
    `551560ba18` (PDN/EM first-pass resize, v1.14.30): when EM sizing forces a
    resize the PnR step is RE-DISPATCHED, so the SAME producer kind is stamped
    a second time. There is no fourth producing KIND — the runner still
    produces synth, pnr and gds — so the defect this tripwire exists to catch
    (#755: "a fourth producing step added without the key") did not happen.
    The guard was counting TEXT OCCURRENCES, which cannot tell a legitimate
    re-stamp from a new unguarded producer.

    Raising 3 to 4 would freeze an instant into a contract: the next
    re-dispatch expires it again, and it would STILL pass a genuinely new
    `_write_producer_identity(..., "drc")` site, because that is also 4.
    Deleting it would leave the #755 shape unguarded. So the population is
    defined by BEHAVIOUR — which producer kinds does `main()` stamp and
    consult — which is blind to re-stamping and loud about a new kind.

    A call site whose kind is not a readable string literal is returned in

    a site cannot vouch for it, and a computed kind is exactly how a new
