"""r46 (subservient x gf180mcuD as a DIE) — three sign-off gates that failed on
the ARTEFACT rather than on the design.

  sta_signoff  "No STA report found (searched *sta*.rpt, *timing*.rpt)" while
               sta_record was reading sta_mcorner_ocv.rpt in the same phase.
               The canonical alias post_route_timing.rpt is filled from the
               single-corner SPEF STA, and that run had REFUSED ITSELF (its own
               population record: "complete": false).
  em_signoff   "No current density values (Javg/Jpeak/mA/A/cm) found" while the
               real cause was PSM failing outright — [ERROR PSM-0069] Check
               connectivity failed on VDD — which nothing downstream said.
  drv_promotion_corroboration
               "the promotion claimed it ended at 11 ... the sign-off report
               shows 14 ... do not ship this route", comparing the resizer's
               in-session count at one corner against DRV rows in the
               MULTI-corner report. Different measurements, not a worse route.

Both directions for each.
