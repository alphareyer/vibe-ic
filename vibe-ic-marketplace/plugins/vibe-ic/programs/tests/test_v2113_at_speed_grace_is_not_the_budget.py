"""vibe-ic#2113 O2 — the at-speed producer spent its WALL BUDGET as a GRACE.

`transition_fault_atpg_run._run_in_docker` launched every one of its container
commands as

    res = _wd.run_host_supervised(docker_cmd, stall_grace_s=float(timeout), ...)

and `timeout` is the caller's BUDGET. `_run_batch` hands it
`max(30, int(wall))`, where `wall = _scaled_wall_budget(timeout, scan_flops)`
starts at 1800 s and grows with the design's flop count. Two different
quantities were sharing one number, and spending one as the other cost both:

  * THE BUDGET WAS RECORDED NOWHERE. No `hard_ceiling_s` was passed, so the
    number the run was sized against never reached the record and a reader
    could not tell a run that crossed it from one that never came near. Since
    vibe-ic#2051 a ceiling stops nothing — which is exactly what makes it safe
    to pass, and what makes leaving it out a deleted number rather than a
    removed clock.
  * THE STILLNESS WINDOW BECAME WHATEVER THE BUDGET HAPPENED TO BE — 1800 s
    and up for the SAT batch, 120 s for the solver probe, 60 s for a `fault
    cut`. The number that decides "is this job hung" was never anybody's
    answer to that question; it was a runtime estimate reused for a question
    about stillness.

THE ASSERTIONS HERE ARE ON NON-DEFAULT VALUES ON PURPOSE (the vacuous
`== default` trap, vibe-ic#2097): every number this file checks is chosen so
that it can equal neither `_watchdog.DEFAULT_STALL_GRACE_S` nor
`DEFAULT_HARD_CEILING_S`, and `test_the_probe_values_are_not_the_defaults`
re-derives that fact rather than trusting the comment.
