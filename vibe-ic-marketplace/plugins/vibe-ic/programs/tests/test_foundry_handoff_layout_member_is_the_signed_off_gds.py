"""The foundry hand-off package's layout member IS the signed-off GDS.

MEASURED on spm run23 (lane icspm5): a full phase-3 re-run moved pnr/spm.gds
and stage4/gds/spm.gds a7bf4526... -> 46459f4a... (signed off), while
stage4/foundry_handoff/spm.gds kept a7bf4526... . The runner packaged members
copy-if-absent by HARDLINK; the source's rewrite-by-rename left the link on the
old inode, and nothing compared the member with what was signed off.

Now: `foundry_handoff_pack_gen.package_layout_members` re-derives every member
from the signed-off GDS on every run (by copy) and records member + source
sha256 in mask_spec.json; `foundry_handoff_package_check` (step 38's blocking
gate) refuses a member whose bytes are not the signed-off GDS's.
