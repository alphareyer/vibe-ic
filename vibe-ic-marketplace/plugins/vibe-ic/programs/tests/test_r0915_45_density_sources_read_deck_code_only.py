"""`analog_converter_density_grade._sources` reads deck CODE, never a sentence —
measured, so the `_NOT_PROSE` entry beside it is evidence and not an assertion.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `prose_polarity_consulted_check --ratchet` named
`analog_converter_density_grade::_sources` the first time it was pushed: the
function regex-matches over a text argument and writes the captured value into
a record, which is the #706/#711 shape — a value taken out of a sentence and
published as a declaration, with nothing asking whether the sentence DENIES it.

The predicate is STRUCTURAL (an AST walk), so no amount of stripping changes
its verdict; the register is where the argument goes. But the register's own
bar is "measured, not asserted", and this file is that measurement.

THE ARGUMENT. The polarity question has no referent here, because no sentence
reaches the regex: every input goes through
`analog_pdk_deck_context.spice_code_only`, which blanks every `*` comment line
and every `;` / `$` inline comment — the only places English lives in a SPICE
deck. And the A4 decks this reads are FULL of English: the power-on sequence
note, the vector-retention note and the resolution-stimulus note are all `*`
lines that name `v_in`, `vrefp` and their values in prose.

SPICE ALSO HAS NO NEGATION FORM. A source card cannot say "this is NOT the
input level"; an absent source is simply absent, and absence is already how
this function reports it — a missing `vin`, `vrefp` or `vrefn` is refused by
name (`density_no_input_dc_level`, `density_no_reference_pair`), never guessed.

BOTH DIRECTIONS, ON THE SAME TRIALS:
  * every denial token of `_prose_polarity`'s own vocabulary — both tiers, the
    five CJK spellings included — each carrying a DECLARATION-SHAPED payload
    that mints a rival input level, in each of the 4 positions a sentence can
    physically occupy around these cards, moves 0 published answers;
  * MUTATION: with `spice_code_only` replaced by the identity — the strip
    deleted — the SAME trials move, so the strip is load-bearing;
  * NEGATIVE CONTROL: the identical payload spliced in as CODE moves the
    published answer with the strip ON, so the fixture could have moved and the
    zero is a statement about the grammar rather than about the fixture.

No chip / SKU / foundry literal.

    lives in a SPICE deck begins with something else — `*` opens a comment
    line, `;` and `$` can only follow code on a line that already matched or
    not, and SPICE has no block comment — so no sentence can reach the regex
    whether or not the strip runs.

    The strip stays as defence in depth against a future reader that is not
    anchored, and it is recorded here as exactly that rather than as the
