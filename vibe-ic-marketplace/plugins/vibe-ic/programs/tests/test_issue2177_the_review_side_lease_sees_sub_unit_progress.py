"""vibe-ic#2177, the REVIEW-side half — the outer lease was still a wall clock.

WHAT THE LANDED FIX REPAIRED, AND WHAT IT DID NOT
=================================================
`_gate_inflight_progress` gave the lease `repo_hygiene_parallel` holds over
each SHARD a sub-unit signal, so a gate that is merely slow is no longer
killed.  Driven on this repo's own 155-gate set at a 300 s lease: the pre-fix
caller (`inflight_path=None`) died at 600 s with rc 199 and NO summary, and
the fix ran the same set to completion.

The lease one level out was untouched.  `gatekeeper_review.repo_hygiene_gate`
supervises the COORDINATOR with::

    _wd.run_supervised(command, log_path=progress,
                       stall_grace_s=_HYGIENE_STALL_GRACE_S)   # 1800 s

and its own refusal text names its only two signals -- "no output or
completed-gate record advanced for 1800s".  The in-flight files are PRIVATE TO
EACH WORKER (`repo_hygiene_parallel` writes one per shard per arm and says
"nothing downstream reads this channel"), so nothing that supervisor can see
moves while one long gate is in flight.

THE ARITHMETIC IS DERIVED FROM THE SHIPPED ARTEFACTS, never typed: see
`derived_silent_tail()` below.  At v1.20.0 it is 2556 - 646 = 1910 s of
unavoidable silence against an 1800 s lease -- the issue's own sentence, "a
wall-clock bound below its subject's own runtime", one supervisor out.

WHAT IS ASSERTED HERE, AND IN WHICH DIRECTION
=============================================
1. A child that reports sub-unit progress and NOTHING else survives an outer
   lease a fraction of its runtime.  DRIVEN: a real child, the real
   `_watchdog.run_supervised`, the real `_gate_inflight_progress` writer.
2. THE RED CONTROL / THE MUTATION.  The same child with the relay not entered
   -- byte-equivalent to the pre-patch caller -- IS killed at its lease with
   `_watchdog.RC_STALLED`.  A fix whose removal changes nothing was never one.
3. The relay renews only on rows the reader ACCEPTS: an unassigned label
   freezes the score and is reported once, so a shard cannot hold the outer
   lease open with rows the protocol refuses.
4. With no shard channel the relay starts no thread and prints nothing.

chip/tool-AGNOSTIC: `sleep`, a temporary directory and this repo's own
programs.  No IC, no PDK, no vendor, no benchmark.
