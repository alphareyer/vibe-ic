"""The bit-mapping contract drives a generator AND a test that discriminates it.

#2215 asks for three things beyond retaining the contract, and each is a
separate claim with a separate way of being wrong:

  1. program-generated RTL implements the stated mapping, preserves the other
     payload bits, and obeys the stated conditions;
  2. the emitted test is BRANCH-DISCRIMINATING -- "a deliberately omitted
     inversion fails the same immutable test that the corrected output
     passes; a test that merely mentions signal names is insufficient";
  3. an incomplete, inconsistent or unsupported contract REFUSES automatic
     generation instead of inventing the missing part.

THE MUTATION TEST IS THE LOAD-BEARING ONE. The RTL and the test come from the
same contract, so their agreeing proves nothing on its own. What is measured
here is SENSITIVITY: the emitted RTL is mutated -- the conditional inversion
removed, one payload bit tied low, the extension inverted -- and the SAME
immutable test, unchanged, must fail on each. A test that survives a mutation
is a test that would have accepted a wrong candidate.

chip-AGNOSTIC: synthetic signal names throughout; the only prose is the
issue's own public-input fixture.
