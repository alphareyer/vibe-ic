"""Tests for container_image_provenance.

The load-bearing property is NOT that the checker passes on a good container —
it is that it FAILS on each of the two real defects it was written for:

  * a container name that resolves to a DIFFERENT image than the one pinned
    (the silent stale-container substitution), and
  * an IMAGE ref passed where a CONTAINER name belongs (the soft degradation).

Each test therefore asserts the failing verdict with the defect present, and the
passing verdict with it absent. Docker is never required: `inspect_container` /
`_resolve_image_id` are stubbed so the checker's LOGIC is what is under test.
