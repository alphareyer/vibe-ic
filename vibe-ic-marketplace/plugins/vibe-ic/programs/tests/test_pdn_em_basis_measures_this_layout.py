"""The PDN's supply current must describe the layout being sized, and a prior
EM resize binds only when its recorded strap floor reached the drawn DEF.

THE TWO DEFECTS THIS FILE DEFENDS AGAINST
=========================================
`step_pnr` derives the PDN strap-width floor from an EM measurement, but the EM
reports are written by `step_canonicalize_artefacts`, which runs AFTER PnR —
verified statically (enclosing defs) and from two real run logs. So the first
PnR of any run can only ever read a PREVIOUS run's measurement.

`_pdn_em_first_pass_resize` closes that gap inside a run by re-measuring and
re-dispatching PnR once. It was bounded by a sentinel written into the project
tree that NOTHING ever removes, so the bound retired the corrector for the life
of the tree. MEASURED on spm run23: a sentinel dated 2026-09-23 18:50 left two
later runs with no corrector, and the current the PDN was sized from drifted
2.900e-03 -> 2.600e-03 -> 2.860e-03 with the design unchanged. The control that
proves it is not the code: the SAME commit re-run on the drifted tree
reproduced the drifted number.

The sentinel records the DEF it measured and the floor it requested. A same-run
token blocks a third PnR even while the second pass has not applied that floor.
On a later run, the recorded DEF digest alone is insufficient: a failed second
pass can leave the same narrow DEF on disk. The drawn strap widths decide.

WHY NOT mtime, AND WHY NOT `measured_subject.def_sha256`. "Written during this
run" is not identity: a same-build re-run that cache-hits the PnR DEF holds a
measurement of exactly this layout, and refusing it by clock discards an
accurate number and republishes the sizing record as NOT_DERIVED for a DEF that
WAS drawn with the floor. And `_pdn_em_measured_subject` digests the DEF at
READ time, so comparing it to the DEF on disk compares the file with itself and
is true always — a check that cannot fail is not a check. The subject digest is
therefore RECORDED BY THE PRODUCER, and a measurement carrying none is declined.
