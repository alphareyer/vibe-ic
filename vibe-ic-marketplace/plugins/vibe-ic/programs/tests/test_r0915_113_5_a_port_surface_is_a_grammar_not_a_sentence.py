"""R-0915-113(5) — `bus_contract` reads a PORT SURFACE, and a name is not a sentence.

WHAT WENT RED, and it was mine. #2418 landed `stated_vector_bus_oracle_gen`;
`test_the_polarity_ratchet_passes_on_this_tree` went red on live main
8337cc81f with

    [FAIL] 1 prose extractor(s) read a value out of a sentence and write it as
    a declaration without asking whether the sentence DENIES it, and are NOT
    in the offender register: stated_vector_bus_oracle_gen::bus_contract

The detector is right about the SHAPE — one `.search`, and a declared value
(`rst_active_low`) written from what it matched. It is the claim about the
INPUT that decides which repair is correct, and this input has no sentence in
it: the argument is the DUT's own `(direction, width, name)` triple list,
either `testbench_gen.resolve_dut` parsing a module header or L9's `ports`
array carrying the same identifiers. There is no free-text field, so there is
nowhere a denial could be written; and an identifier has no negation form —
there is no way to spell "this reset is NOT active low" in a Verilog name.

THE CLAIM IS THEREFORE A `_NOT_PROSE` ENTRY, AND THIS FILE IS ITS ARGUMENT.
Measured, not asserted, over ALL of `_prose_polarity`'s vocabulary — the CJK
spellings included — in every place a denial could act on this reader, with
negative controls proving the fixture can move the answer it claims is fixed.
No register entry, and the ratchet is not weakened: the file below re-runs it.
