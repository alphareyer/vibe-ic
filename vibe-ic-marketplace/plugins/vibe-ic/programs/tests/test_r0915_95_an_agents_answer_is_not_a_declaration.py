"""R-0915-95 — an agent's answer to an OWNER-ONLY question is not a declaration.

WHAT WAS MEASURED. On 2026-09-06 an agent authored
`input/step_0_5ic_answers.json` for five designs and wrote `deliverable` into
each of them "cited from the input docs", inferring HARDMACRO from those
documents' SILENCE about a pad ring. The files were well-formed.
`tapeout_declaration_check` reported PASS, `route_of` selected the IP terminal,
every lane ran the IP route for eleven days, and an IP result was published as
an IC PASS. The owner ruled on 2026-09-17 (R-0915-95) that all five are dies.

Nothing in the tree could have caught it. The questionnaire recorded WHAT was
answered and never WHO answered it, so an inference and a declaration were the
same bytes.

EVERY PROPERTY BELOW IS ASSERTED IN THE DIRECTION THAT COULD FAIL.

  1. POSITIVE     an owner-attested answer IS a declaration, all the way to the
                  router file. Without this the guard could be satisfied by
                  refusing everything, which is the cheapest wrong fix here.
  2. NEGATIVE     the same bytes without the owner behind them are refused, by
                  the one reader, at the producer AND at the gate -- and the
                  refusal is `NOT_DECLARED` with the owner's own wording.
  3. DISCRIMINATION  an UNANSWERED owner-only question is NOT refused. A blank
                  declaration stays legal; a guard that reddens on silence is
                  measuring the wrong thing and would halt every design that
                  has not reached step 0.5ic yet.
  4. ONE READER   there is no second reader of `deliverable` left to disagree
                  with the first -- asserted over the AST of the two modules
                  that carried one, not over a grep.
  5. DELETED      the docs-derived inference is GONE, not disabled: a project
                  carrying the very report it used to read yields no
                  deliverable at all.

chip-AGNOSTIC: no vendor, foundry, process node, SKU or design name.
