"""SLT53B handback — step 37.3 produced nothing on the run that needed it most.

THE INPUT, the FULL S arm (spm end-to-end on 0.3.67, the rollback/FAIL path,
DRC 4, step 37 "GDS output only if PV fully clean" FAILs):

    step 37.3  FAIL  missing_artefact      <- and no receipt, no xor artefact,
                                             no log line
    step 37.4  NOT_MEASURED  upstream_failed

while BOTH of 37.3's inputs sat on disk throughout: the retained boundary
`chip_top.prefinish.gds` at 73,850,000 B (the retention added by the previous
commit DID fire) and the shipped GDS at 102,921,972 B.

TWO DEFECTS, and the second is why the first could never have worked.

(1) A VERDICT DEPENDENCY WHERE A FILE DEPENDENCY BELONGED. 37.3 declared
    `blocks_on: [37]`, so a failed PV cascaded it away. But its subject -- does
    the shipped GDS differ from this run's own pre-finishing boundary on the
    design layers -- is answerable from those two artefacts alone. And the run
    where the answer matters MOST is exactly this one: a fidelity defect
    (finishing corrupting design geometry) is a candidate CAUSE of the DRC
    violations that failed PV, so gating the check on PV being clean means it can
    never help diagnose the failure it might explain. R-0915-129's own words: "a
    metric with no producer, not a metric that cannot be produced".
    So the step is now CONDITIONAL on its subject and has no `blocks_on`.

(2) THE STEP'S ONLY PRODUCER WAS ITS OWN GATE CLAUSE, which cannot work:
    compliance reads `required_outputs` BEFORE it runs the clause, so the
    artefact is missing, the step reports FAIL/missing_artefact, and the clause
    that would have written it never runs. REPRODUCED LOCALLY by failing step 37
    on a copy of run21 -- same three rows as the S arm, `gds_xor.json produced:
    False`. The producer is now invoked in `_PRE_AUDIT_PRODUCERS`, which runs on
    EVERY path before the audit reads anything.

AND A TRAP I WALKED INTO WHILE FIXING IT, pinned below because it fails QUIETLY:
the pre-audit hook passes `--pdk-container` to PDK-aware gates. This gate drives
KLayout and takes `--container`. Wired without it, the producer ran, found no
runner, and wrote a NOT_DETERMINED receipt -- on a tree whose runner `covers()`
returns True for. The receipt EXISTED, so "produced" looked satisfied while the
comparison had not run. A produced receipt is not a performed measurement.

MEASURED after both fixes, on a copy of run21 with step 37 forced to FAIL:
    no subject            -> NOT_APPLICABLE (never FAIL/missing_artefact)
    subject + boundary    -> PASS, reference kind `retained`, 38 layer(s)
                             compared, 0 design-layer difference(s)
