"""test_one_owner_reads_the_audits_verdict.py

ONE PRODUCER, THREE READERS, AND THEY DISAGREED.

`flow_compliance_check` answers on two channels: one `Overall: <word>` line and an exit
code. Three programs read that answer and each read it its own way:

    design_one_shot_runner.step_final_audit          the phase-2/3 step table
    phase23_completion_self_audit_check              by its own docstring, "the ONLY signal
                                                     that authorises a 'Phase 2+3 complete'
                                                     claim"
    final_report_generate._run_audit                 the `final_summary.md` headline

MEASURED on main fd9e3342f, driving each real reader with the audit's reconciliation-canary
stdout and rc 1 — a state the audit is DESIGNED to reach (vibe-ic#2092: print the run word,
print "do not quote its counts", say the status is unchanged, `return 1`):

    step_final_audit                    NOT_MEASURED   (fixed in #2572)
    phase23_completion_self_audit_check exit 0, "Overall: PASS — every canonical step
                                        executed and verified."
    final_report_generate               headline PASS

So after #2572 the orchestrator said "could not certify" while the acceptance gate still
authorised completion. Two readers were left with the defect the third had fixed, which is
what a private copy of a shared question buys.

THE RULE, with no tool or step name in it:

    A producer has as many channels as it chooses to use, and one question has one owner.
    A consumer that reads a word while ignoring the exit code has not read the producer;
    three consumers that each read it their own way will eventually publish opposite
    verdicts about one run.

Fixtures quote the producer's OWN prints and the vocabulary's OWN words.
