"""vibe-ic#2177 — a gate slower than the stall lease is not a wedged one.

THE DEFECT, IN THIS REPO'S OWN SHIPPED NUMBERS
==============================================
The hygiene shard is supervised by `_owned_process_supervisor` in attestation
mode, where `output_progress=False` and the ONLY forward-progress signal is one
attestation row per COMPLETED GATE.  The lease is spent between two consecutive
validated events, so the unit that gets killed is a WHOLE GATE, and the stall
grace is therefore a wall clock for any single gate.

`hygiene_gate_profile.json` at v1.19.39, the profile this repo SHIPS::

    gates are host-independent      2556 s
    an argued direction is pinned    646 s

against the graces actually in force::

    repo_hygiene_parallel.DEFAULT_STALL_GRACE_S       300 s
    gatekeeper_review._HYGIENE_STALL_GRACE_S         1800 s

Two gates above the first; one above the second.  MEASURED on 8HD-6, three
landing logs of 2026-08-27 (`~/j1786/baseev/base_land.log` and the two under
`~/j1786/tmp/gk_land_diff.8oX709/`), all three carrying::

    arm A shard 0: PROGRESS_PROTOCOL_INCOMPLETE: attestation progress ended
    before assigned gates completed: an argued direction is pinned; progress
    watchdog outcome=stalled, rc=199; the shard did not complete naturally

and the landing then reporting `16 wiring error(s) in the hygiene gate
declarations, so the set certifies nothing`.  Not one of those sixteen was a
property of the tree.

WHAT IS ASSERTED HERE, AND IN WHICH DIRECTION
=============================================
1. A supervised job that runs FAR past its stall lease while reporting
   sub-unit progress COMPLETES.  It is DRIVEN — a real child process under the
   real `run_owned` — not simulated.
2. A job that stops reporting IS killed, and the refusal NAMES the gate that
   was in flight and how long the lease had gone unrenewed.
3. THE MUTATION.  Delete the in-flight renewal (the one line that adds
   `inflight_probe.sample()` to the score) and arm 1 must go red — that is the
   wall clock restored, and a fix whose removal changes nothing was never a
   fix.  Driven by monkeypatching the reader to a frozen score, which is
   byte-equivalent to the channel contributing nothing.
4. The protocol refuses what it must refuse: an unassigned label, a unit that
   does not advance, a denominator that moves, a rewritten history.  A channel
   that accepted those would be a lease anyone could hold open forever.

chip/tool-AGNOSTIC: `sleep`, `printf` and a temporary directory.  No IC, no
PDK, no vendor, no benchmark.
