"""Two rulings of 2026-09-20, both derived from an owner-attested `deliverable`.

R-0915 (1): **a DIE owes NO IP delivery set.** Step 37.5ip's producers build the
LEF/lib/Verilog/GDS kit and the six IP documents. Measured on spm x gf180mcuD,
DIE route (v1.22.10, run6): that kit cost 7278.5 s — the run's longest step by a
factor of two and a half — and `ip_release_docs_gen` then refused it anyway. The
step now stands down BY DECLARATION, with the declaration cited: the flow row via
37.5ip's own `delivery_declares` condition, and the runner channel (which
dispatches the two producers directly) via a typed N/A record.

R-0915 (2): **on a DIE with no operator template the die is its own operator
(37.5self).** There is no external slot to measure against — the operator
catalogue on disk is information, not a purchase — so the file that plays the
slot's part is the design's OWN declaration (`pad_signal_map` /
`pad_order_by_side`, written at step 0.5ic), measured by signal name against
the pins the design declares.

WHERE THE DESIGN DECLARED NO RING, THIS STEP DOES NOT GUESS AND DOES NOT PASS.
The ring is then generated at step 15.5ic, and reading that output from step 2
is the dependency `test_matrix_d5_deps_correct` refuses and cannot repair:
15.5ic already has step 2 in its own ancestry, so the edge is CIRCULAR
(measured, on the first cut of this change: `D5-MISSING-EDGE: step 2 reads
'reports/phase3/padring.json', declared as a required_output of step 15.5ic`).
The measurement is not lost — `pad_ring_check` (BTERM_WITHOUT_PAD) and
`pad_bterm_coincidence_check` (per net, geometric) make it at 15.5ic, where the
ring exists — so this step names them and reports UNDECIDED. Measured on run7:
the design declares neither key, and 15.5ic's own record carries
`n_ports_on_a_pad: 38`.

A HARDMACRO still owes the IP set, and still budgets against an operator slot.
Both directions are tested here.
