"""Two rulings of 2026-09-20, both derived from an owner-attested `deliverable`.

R-0915 (1): **a DIE owes NO IP delivery set.** Step 37.5ip's producers build the
LEF/lib/Verilog/GDS kit and the six IP documents. Measured on spm x gf180mcuD,
DIE route (v1.22.10, run6): that kit cost 7278.5 s — the run's longest step by a
factor of two and a half — and `ip_release_docs_gen` then refused it anyway. The
step now stands down BY DECLARATION, with the declaration cited: the flow row via
37.5ip's own `delivery_declares` condition, and the runner channel (which
dispatches the two producers directly) via a typed N/A record.

R-0915 (2): **on a DIE with no operator template the die is its own operator
(37.5self).** There is no external slot to measure against — the operator
catalogue on disk is information, not a purchase — so the file that plays the
slot's part is the design's OWN declaration (`pad_signal_map` /
`pad_order_by_side`, written at step 0.5ic), measured by signal name against
the pins the design declares.

WHERE THE DESIGN DECLARED NO RING, THIS STEP DOES NOT GUESS AND DOES NOT PASS.
The ring is then generated at step 15.5ic, and reading that output from step 2
is the dependency `test_matrix_d5_deps_correct` refuses and cannot repair:
15.5ic already has step 2 in its own ancestry, so the edge is CIRCULAR
(measured, on the first cut of this change: `D5-MISSING-EDGE: step 2 reads
'reports/phase3/padring.json', declared as a required_output of step 15.5ic`).
The measurement is not lost — `pad_ring_check` (BTERM_WITHOUT_PAD) and
`pad_bterm_coincidence_check` (per net, geometric) make it at 15.5ic, where the
ring exists — so this step names them and reports UNDECIDED. Measured on run7:
the design declares neither key, and 15.5ic's own record carries
`n_ports_on_a_pad: 38`.

SUPERSEDED IN PART BY R-0915-101 (2026-09-21) — read the next paragraph before
the one above it. The paragraph above describes the DEFERRAL: a die that declared
no `pad_signal_map` was reported UNDECIDED / BLOCKED_BY_UPSTREAM and pointed at
step 15.5ic. That answer was not a verdict about the design's pad budget, and it
cost the whole IC path: `BLOCKED_BY_UPSTREAM` is not skip-eligible, so the P0
umbrella booked flow step 2 INCOMPLETE and step 4's 10/10 L10 oracles were voided
beneath it.

R-0915-101 rules that on a DIE the budget IS the die's own pad ring, and that the
design usually HAS stated that ring — in the pad-placement section of its own
L-documents, which is where `io_pad_chip_top_gen` already derives
`pad_order_by_side` and `SIGNAL_MAP` from at 15.5ic. `slot_pad_budget_check` now
derives it from that same source through the same reader and DECIDES. What
survives untouched is the law this file was written to protect, and each re-pinned
case below asserts it explicitly:

  * this step still reads NO artefact a later step produces — asserted on the
    reader itself (`LPP.DOC_DIRS` is design INPUT only) as well as on the report;
  * a DIE is still NEVER `NOT_APPLICABLE`;
  * a die that states its ring NOWHERE still does not pass — it is `UNDECIDED`
    with a NAMED finding, now classified `ZERO_DENOMINATOR` (a design-input gap)
    rather than `BLOCKED_BY_UPSTREAM` (a wait on a step that generates the ring
    FROM the declaration the design did not write).

The three case NAMES that say "deferred" are KEPT so the id set is stable across
this change; each docstring says what it now asserts.

A HARDMACRO still owes the IP set, and still budgets against an operator slot.
Both directions are tested here.
