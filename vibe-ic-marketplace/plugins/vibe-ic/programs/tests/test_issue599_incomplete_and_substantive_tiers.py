"""#599 D1 + step 14 — the roll-up had no word between PASS and VACUOUS-PASS.

Two different things arrived wearing the same token, and neither gate was what
was wrong:

  * step 14  `yosys_hilomap_required_check` prints `VACUOUS_PASS:` because no
             `.ys` script existed, and in the same sentence reports that the
             runner's INLINE `yosys -p` command was extracted and verified.
             Its docstring keeps the vacuous word ON PURPOSE and says
             `reason_class` carries how much was verified. The roll-up read the
             token and never the reason.

  * D1       `phase1_expert_parse_track` used to return VACUOUS_PASS when no
             deterministic rule applied AND the AI sub-track never answered.
             Issue #1973 promotes that applicable, unexecuted state to a real
             INCOMPLETE exit: handoff creation is not expert execution.

DISCLOSED BY A PRINTED SENTINEL, never by matching a gate's prose — matching
prose is how a gate that says "I verified the inline command" was read as "I
examined nothing" to begin with.

The generic printed INCOMPLETE tier remains a disclosure when a gate exits 0.
The D1 expert track now exits 1 on that same state because its execution is
mandatory while its eventual design findings remain advisory. Those are two
different policies and must not share one return code.
