"""Regression for #2110 — the FIRST of the twelve null class profiles:
`processor_cpu`.

THE DEFECT, MEASURED ON THE TWO CORPUS DESIGNS OF THE CLASS. #2094 made
expert-pack retrieval class-first and named every registered ic_class in the
DB's `registered_class_profiles`, twelve of them as `null` — a DECLARED gap, so
those classes kept the unconfined phrase ranking. For `processor_cpu` that gap
was not cosmetic. On pristine main the two corpus designs the shipped
classifier puts in this class got these packs (k=5, host 8hd-3, base
94617408759e):

  a bit-serial RISC-V SoC   integer-clock-divider, serial-parallel-multiplier,
                            mmio-register-controlled-counter,
                            integer-clock-divider, mmio-timer-counter
  a two-stage RISC-V core   axi-stream, integer-clock-divider,
                            mmio-register-controlled-counter,
                            axi-mmio-cdc-datapath, axi-stream-width-downsizer

Ten of ten out-of-class, and not one of `processor-cpu-core`,
`load-store-unit`, `alu-datapath` or `microcoded-datapath-sequencer` in either.
The same literal-phrase mechanism as #2094: "bit-serial", "clock", "counter",
"stream" are words a processor spec uses about its own datapath, and they
scored entries whose craft is about designing a clock divider or an AXI stream
resizer. A pack of five entries with no referent in the design is what the
class-first rule exists to stop.

WHAT THIS LANDING ADDS, AND WHY EACH PIECE IS PINNED BOTH WAYS:

  1. THE PROFILE. `processor_cpu` selects four db_classes and carries a
     six-requirement integration contract. Positive: a core brief's whole pack
     is in-class. Negative (THE MUTATION): the same brief with the profile back
     at `null` returns the out-of-class list — and returns it as the DECLARED
     GAP state (no `class_first` key, no contract, no recovered target), not as
     some third thing.

  2. THE SELECTION IS DERIVED, NOT ASSERTED. Each of the four db_classes is
     tied to one of the six structural features the shipped classifier itself
     uses to put a design in this class, so the candidate set is derived from
     the code that assigns the class rather than from an author's taste.

  3. THE THIRD TARGET-MODULE CONVENTION. One of the two designs states its top
     module with the NAME BEFORE THE PHRASE, which the two shipped conventions
     do not read, so its pack was ASSEMBLED_INCOMPLETE. The convention is
     APPENDED, so it can only answer where both earlier ones answered nothing:
     pinned by an input that both earlier ones DO answer, whose answer must not
     move.

chip-AGNOSTIC: every fixture below is synthetic. The one real-corpus fact used
is the SENTENCE SHAPE, which names no chip, vendor, SKU or process node.
