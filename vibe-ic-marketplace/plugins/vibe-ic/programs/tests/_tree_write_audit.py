"""programs/tests/_tree_write_audit.py -- run test nodes and record every write
they make under a root, including writes they undo before they finish.

WHY THIS EXISTS
===============
`suite_write_guard` compares two `git status` snapshots, and says so: "a write
made AND reverted inside a single test is invisible to a snapshot taken after
it". That is exactly the shape of a probe writer -- plant a file in the shipped
`programs/`, measure, unlink it in a `finally`. Nothing is left for a snapshot
to see, but every concurrent xdist worker that lists the tree in between sees
the file appear and vanish, and one of them reads it after the unlink
(`FileNotFoundError` in `test_upstream_mirror_is_pinned`, 8HD-8, 2026-09-28).

So this records the WRITE itself. A `sitecustomize` placed first on the child's
`PYTHONPATH` installs `sys.addaudithook` in the pytest child and in every Python
process it starts (the same mechanism as `step_input_scope.install_guard`).
CPython raises the `open` event from C for `open()`, `Path.write_text` and
`os.open` alike, and `os.remove`/`os.rename`/`os.mkdir`/`os.chmod`/
`shutil.rmtree`/... for the rest, whether the path is absolute, relative to the
cwd, or relative to a directory fd. Each event is tagged with
`PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST` ('' = collection).

WHAT IT DOES NOT SEE, stated so it is not read as a guarantee: a write made by a
non-Python process (a shell `>`, a compiled tool); a Python child started with
`-I`/`-S` or a scrubbed environment; a write under `__pycache__`/
`.pytest_cache` or to a `*.pyc` (bytecode churn, excluded on purpose); and a
BARE-NAME `os.open` (no directory component), which cannot be placed -- see the
fourth calibration below.

PATH RESOLUTION -- six calibrations, all measured:
  * with no `dir_fd`, CPython puts `dir_fd=-1` in every os-level event
    (`os.remove`, `os.rename`/`os.replace`, `os.mkdir`, `os.rmdir`,
    `os.chmod`, `os.chown`, `os.utime`, `os.symlink`, `os.link`); -1 means
    the cwd. Treating it as a descriptor dropped every cwd-relative change
    (review of PR fxprobe, 2026-09-28); only a descriptor >= 0 is joined.
  * `shutil.rmtree` removes entries by bare NAME relative to a directory fd;
    reading that name against the cwd invented deletions under the plugin root.
    The name is joined onto `/proc/self/fd/<dir_fd>` instead.
  * removing or renaming a SYMLINK acts on the entry, not its target. Resolving
    the whole path reported a tmp symlink farm's cleanup as the deletion of
    every file it pointed at. Entry-level events resolve only the parent.
  * an `O_TMPFILE` open names a directory and creates no entry in it, so it is
    not a write a reader can see (`tempfile.TemporaryFile()` with the cwd as
    its temp dir did this 45 times in one sweep).
  * `os.open` raises the `open` event WITHOUT its `dir_fd`, so a bare name from
    `os.open` cannot be placed: the runner's fd-bound publisher opens
    `.<name>.tmp.<pid>.<hex>` relative to a directory fd inside a tmp project,
    and reading it against the cwd reported it in the plugin root. A bare-name
    `os.open` is therefore NOT recorded -- the stated blind spot. A relative
    `os.open` WITH a directory component (`Path("programs/x").touch()`) is read
    against the cwd, and a bare name through builtin `open()` (mode is a
    string) has no directory fd to be relative to, so both ARE recorded.
  * the `os.mkdir` event fires before the call, and `mkdir(exist_ok=True)` on a
    directory that already exists changes nothing. Seven such events (tracked
    fixture dirs, `_shared/integration_fixtures`, the plugin root itself)
    came out of one sweep; a mkdir whose target already exists is not recorded.
