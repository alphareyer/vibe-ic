"""R-0915-73 — the conversion-window reset has to clear the FEEDBACK BRANCH,
not just the integrators.

WHAT WAS WRONG, MEASURED (lane icadc, F164/F165). The emitted incremental
modulator's reset shorted the two integrators and nothing else. The feedback
branch went on sampling the DAC node straight through the reset, so the FIRST
charge transfer of every conversion carried the LAST DECISION OF THE PREVIOUS
ONE — one full reference step of charge belonging to a different conversion,
dumped into freshly zeroed integrators. No decode can remove it: the bit that
caused it is outside the window being decoded.

BOTH DIRECTIONS, pure arithmetic, no simulator (54 conversion windows of 256
clocks, coherent tone at bin 9, worst over 12 tone phases because the loop is
exactly periodic in 6 windows and a single phase is an accident):

    feedback branch sampling through the reset    ENOB  6.691   (worst)
    feedback branch held at the common mode       ENOB 13.367   (worst)

**6.68 bit**, from one gate term. Confirmed on the ideal-element SPICE harness
of this exact topology — one variable, same deck, same tone, same decode:
sine-fit ENOB 5.685 -> 13.532, with the fit residual falling 236x
(0.008017 -> 0.000034).

WHY IT IS RIGHT AND NOT A TRICK. The loop has made NO DECISION YET for the
first step of a conversion, so the honest feedback value there is ZERO — and a
1-bit DAC cannot produce zero any other way than by not sampling. The gate term
is `clk AND nrstb`, built from the reset complement the design already carries;
outside the reset `nckdac` IS the clock and the branch behaves exactly as it
always did.

No chip / SKU / foundry literal.
