"""A run that declares a window writes only that window's own work.

R-0924-1, the owner's ask: when a gate is wrong, re-run THAT step -- only it. The window was already honoured for DISPATCH; the FINALIZE
TAIL was not, and no flag reached it.

MEASURED before this change, on a copy of benchmark-data/ic/subservient at main
69abc2734, `design_one_shot_runner . --entry-step 4 --exit-step 4`:
    766 files touched, 432 of them OUTSIDE step 4's own workspace
    23 flow_compliance_check invocations, 3 of them over the WHOLE flow
    reports/final_summary.md republished with a fence reading "Steps: 70 total"
for a run that dispatched one step. The leak is not the window: every
out-of-window dispatch site correctly reports NOT_APPLICABLE and names the flag
that pruned it.

WHAT THESE ARMS PIN. Each one fails if the tail is re-enabled for a bounded run:
the five `emit_final_summary` sites, the whole-flow `final_audit`, the
declared-producer sweep, the two gate-identity sweeps and the whole-tree steps
view. The behavioural arms drive the real narrowing predicates rather than
grepping for them, because a source substring cannot tell you a branch bites.
