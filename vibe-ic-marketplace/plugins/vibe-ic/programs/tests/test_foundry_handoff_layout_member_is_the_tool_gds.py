"""Migration 38: with step 37 on LibreLane, the hand-off layout member IS the
tool's final GDS.

review70 step 38 (EXTERNAL_NOT_SOFTWARE, P4): no LibreLane/OpenROAD step writes
a mask spec, WAT plan or scribe frame, so step 38 stays a vibe-ic packaging gate
-- "but source its layout member from LibreLane's final GDS so the
prefinish/stale-member defects cannot recur".

`librelane_step37.run` records the finished GDS it promoted in
`phase3/librelane/37-promotion.json` (`source_sha256`, `canonical`). The
existing stale-member rule compares the member with the signed-off COPY; a copy
rewritten after promotion (and the member re-derived from it) passes that rule
while shipping bytes the tool never produced. `foundry_handoff_package_check`
now refuses that under FOUNDRY_HANDOFF_LAYOUT_NOT_THE_TOOL_OUTPUT. Direct mode
has no tool record and is judged exactly as before.
