"""The lease over a NESTED DRIVER LANE is derived from a measured relay
(vibe-ic#2219).

WHAT WAS WRONG. `test_nested_validated_progress_is_relayed_to_the_outer_session`
held its subject under `stall_window(2.5, starts=2)`. Every event that can
renew THAT lease arrives through the subject's `--progress-relay`, and
`stall_window` has no term that grows when the relay lane gets slower: its lift
is `FLOOR_MULTIPLE * starts * trivial_session_s()`, and `trivial_session_s` is
a bare pytest session. Whether that product happened to cover the lane was
decided by how fast this box starts an interpreter, which is why the test was
RED at `--cpus=1` and GREEN at `--cpus=4` on main and on `next/cyregress`
alike.

MEASURED 2026-09-09 on 8HD-9, live main 6883a9c93 (v1.20.7), pinned image
`vibeic-eda@sha256:89a8fd72…`, `--cpus=1 --memory=8g --pids-limit=1024`. The
driver deletes its private progress directory; it was kept, and every
inter-event gap of the outer lease read off it:

    1.1059  SPAWN -> session_start                     one interpreter start
    0.4705  collect_scan -> item_collected
    0.0002  item_collected -> collection_finish
    2.9234  collection_finish -> matrix-outcome-relay 1        <-- THE SILENCE
    0.0000  x82 relay scores, all sub-millisecond
    1.3084  matrix-outcome-modules 2 -> relay 83  the 2nd wave's lane, warm

`pytest_runtest_logstart` emits NOTHING (it only records the nodeid), so the
whole item preamble is silent BY CONSTRUCTION: between `collection_finish` and
the first relayed score there is no event the protocol could produce. In that
2.9234 s the subject starts, runs its OWN `stall_window(0.45)` — two more
pytest sessions, because the floor is `max(... for _ in range(2))` — and then
starts a driver, which starts a pytest, whose first event becomes a relay score
one probe poll later and an outer `domain_progress` one reader poll after that.

`FLOOR_MULTIPLE * 2 * trivial_session_s` covers 2.9234 s only when
`trivial_session_s >= 0.7308`. The same host read 0.7375 and 0.7990 and 0.7770
within one hour. The colour was the machine's, which is the defect.

BOTH DIRECTIONS ON THE REAL SUBJECT, made deterministic by pinning the box to
each side of that line instead of re-rolling the die (`--cpus=1`, load 13):

    window 2.5   (what the old expression yields at session=0.60)
        rc 199, incomplete, WATCHDOG_STALLED … since_last_progress_s=2.518
    window 5.0262 (`relay_window(2.5)`, same box, same run)
        rc 0, complete, elapsed 15.826 s

The RED arm reproduces the issue's own failure line to the third decimal.
