"""R-0915-162 — a POST-LAYOUT SPICE correlation is built on a POST-ROUTE,
SPEF-bearing STA basis, or it refuses by name.

MEASURED on spm run23 (plugin ec313cde7). `_pick_sta_report` scores
`(stitch, states_operating_point)` and stitch dominates, so:

    report                     stitch  op_pt  STA_BASIS            LIB
    post_route_timing.rpt           2      0  POST_ROUTE_SPEF        6
    pre_pnr_timing.rpt              3      0  PRE_LAYOUT_ESTIMATE    0   <- PICKED
    sta_mcorner_ocv.rpt             2      4  POST_ROUTE_SPEF        2
    sta_spef_based.rpt              2      0  POST_ROUTE_SPEF        6
    sta_spef_multicorner.rpt        2      4  POST_ROUTE_SPEF        2

One extra combinational stage put a 1,860-byte PRE-LAYOUT estimate ahead of
four post-route reports. Step 30 then refused with "pre_pnr_timing.rpt declares
no corner liberty" -- correct, but for the SECOND reason. The first is that a
post-layout deck must never be correlated against a pre-layout, no-parasitics
basis at all: `pre_pnr_timing.rpt`'s own header says it "timed the pre-PnR
synthesis netlist + SDC, emitted BEFORE PnR; interconnect is a pre-floorplan
estimate".

Stamping the pre-layout report with a liberty would have made the refusal go
away by making the gate wrong. The basis is the fix.
