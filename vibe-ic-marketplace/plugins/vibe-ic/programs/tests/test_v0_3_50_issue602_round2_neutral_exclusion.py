"""ORGANIC #602 ROUND 2 — classify-neutral file exclusion.

Field-agent artifact-first re-verify (CLI fed real commits) found
fix_surface_classify returned MIXED for EVERY real commit, defeating its
own reason to exist:

  - EVERY core-agent fix commit bumps marketplace.json + plugin.json (a
    mandatory push step), regenerates INDEX.md, and ships test files.
    Those carried no producer/consumer signal → "ambiguous" → MIXED → a
    needless 40-min re-run on every fix. Measured: #599 (pure run_status
    consumer), #600, #597 all wrongly MIXED. CONSUMER_ONLY only ever
    appeared on hand-crafted bump-less diffs that don't exist in practice.
  - test files were listed under PRODUCERS (their asserts quote producer
    tokens like ".snap(grid_dbu, grid_dbu)") — tests are the author's
    EVIDENCE, not a runtime surface.
  - prose/JSON hunk contexts were scraped for bogus 'symbols' (Auto, the,
    artifact, _).

Round-2 fix: a classify-NEUTRAL exclusion set (version bumps, INDEX.md,
tests, prose .md) dropped before bucketing; symbol extraction restricted
to real def/class/constant (no prose-word fallback). The decisive proof is
the real-commit shape returning the RIGHT verdict, not MIXED.

    THE SKIP THAT USED TO STAND HERE WAS NEVER A PASS (vibe-ic#2145). It read
    "#599 commit not in history" and fired on every checkout, because
    `resolve_commit` only looked 400 commits back and #599's commit is 3094
    back — so this canary had never once been exercised. Then `ebb00b1b4`
    landed with "the #599 label probe" in its SUBJECT while closing #2111 and
    #2106; it entered the window, the old resolver returned it, and this test
    failed on its FIRST EVER exercise against a commit that is not #599's.

    Both halves are fixed in `resolve_commit` (a CLAIM, not a mention; no
    window), so the skip is gone in both directions: the resolution is now
    ASSERTED. If a future history genuinely carries no #599 claim, this goes
    RED and names it, rather than reporting green by not looking.

    THE SUBJECT IS ANCHORED BY CONTENT, NOT BY SHA. A sha literal does not
    survive a history rewrite — the sibling #600 canary below hardcodes
    `6a73bad1` and has been silently skipping since the 2026-09-07 rewrite. The
    real #599 commit is the one that turned `phase1_expert_parse_track`'s
    printed `VACUOUS_PASS:` into `INCOMPLETE:` (see the tie-break test in
    test_v0_3_51_...), so requiring that file in the diff is what makes this a
    canary over #599 rather than over whatever the resolver happened to return.

    ANCHORED BY CONTENT, NOT BY A SHA (vibe-ic#2162). This canary used to read
    `git show 6a73bad1`. That sha is gone -- the pre-v1.0.0 history was squashed
    into one "initial public release" commit -- so it had been SKIPPING on every
    checkout, silently, for as long as that squash has existed. A skip is not a
    pass, and a canary that stopped watching without anyone noticing is worse
    than no canary.

    Rewiring it to the ISSUE NUMBER is the obvious repair and it is wrong,
    measured: `resolve_commit("600")` reaches `311f8fc81bcf`, a CONSUMER_ONLY
    commit, so it would turn a silent skip into a red that says nothing about
    the classifier. An issue number is no more durable than a sha; both name a
    commit, and this canary is about a KIND of commit.

    So the subject is a PREDICATE over the diff -- see
    `_issue600_producing_commits`, which selects by the enclosing symbol of the
    hunks and never by `classify_diff` (selecting with the classifier and then
    asserting its answer is a tautology). MEASURED on this history (main
    89f66304f5a0): 37 commits qualify -- 31 MIXED, 6 PRODUCER, 0 CONSUMER_ONLY.

    This file's half guards the #602 NEUTRAL EXCLUSION: every one of those 37
    also bumps the version manifests and ships test files, and before #602 that
    alone made each of them MIXED-by-ambiguity. Its twin in the #603 file guards
    the widened consumer vocabulary. Two canaries, because one could not say
    which of the two rules moved a verdict."""
