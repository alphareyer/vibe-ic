"""A macro somebody else places has no die edge, so it owes no die steps.

vibe-ic#2277, flow steps 15.5ic / 26.5ic / 37.5ic and step 31. MEASURED on live
main 79506306d (lane icspm4, run1).

DIE STEPS (class a, ABSENT SUBJECT). All three rows condition on ROUTER FILES --
`input/submission_template/slots/*.yaml` OR `SELF_TAPEOUT.txt` -- and the only
N/A a hardmacro was offered is `NO_TEMPLATE.txt`. Since 0.5ic's fetch was wired,
a PDK with a LIVE shuttle in the registry has the operator's whole CATALOGUE
ingested as `slots/*.yaml` whether or not the design bought a slot, and no
`NO_TEMPLATE.txt` is written. So a delivery whose own input declares
`deliverable=HARDMACRO` with `operator_template.path/.slot` null matched the
`any_of`, all three rows were judged APPLICABLE, every output was owed, the
producers correctly wrote nothing (`tapeout_precheck` step_applies=false,
`tapeout_docs_gen` NOT_APPLICABLE, `die_finishing_gen._hardmacro_skip`), and the
rows read MISSING -- failing stage3 and stage4 compliance. RULINGS R12
(2026-09-07): a hardmacro exposes pins, gets no pad ring and no die ring.

STEP 31 (class c, PRODUCER GAP). `reports/phase3/perc_sweep.json` is a step-31
`required_output` and `perc_corpus_sweep` is named under its `programs:`, but no
clause invoked it -- the reach clause only READS the document. 8 of 9 outputs
were produced and the ninth was owed by nobody. `flow_declared_producer_run`
could not adopt it either: it matched only `--json`, and this producer writes
through `--report` because its own `--json` is a boolean.
