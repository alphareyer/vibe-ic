"""vibe-ic#2118 — a HARDMACRO delivery must not be handed a DIE's declarations.

`die_area_um`, `die_origin_um`, `core_area_um` and `fp_sizing` are all
`required_for=(DELIVERABLE_DIE,)` in `_tapeout_declaration`'s own schema — the
module states, question by question, that a macro somebody else places owes no
answer about a die. `phase3_one_shot_runner.publish_tapeout_declarations`
published `die_area_um` and `die_origin_um` onto a HARDMACRO delivery anyway.

The NUMBER was never wrong: `declared_die_rect` returns the run's own floorplan
rectangle, which on a macro run is the macro's own bounding box. The CLAIM
around it was — any consumer that believes the name reads it as a die. This is
the seal-ring class of vibe-ic#2112 one step up: the same wrong premise, "what
leaves this flow is a die", taken about SIZE instead of about a ring.

THE SHAPE PROVEN HERE
  * a HARDMACRO publishes `macro_area_um` / `macro_origin_um` and REFUSES the
    `die_*` pair BY NAME (a key nobody published and a key somebody declined
    are different facts);
  * a DIE publishes exactly what it published before, byte for byte, and
    refuses the `macro_*` pair by name;
  * an UNDECLARED deliverable publishes NEITHER — `applicable` already says
    such a design owes every question, and choosing one name would be a guess
    wearing a derivation's clothes;
  * `general_precheck`'s `KLayout.CheckSize` still reaches a verdict on a
    hardmacro, from the MACRO box — PASS when it matches and FAIL when it does
    not, so the rung is not a filter that always agrees;
  * a `die_area_um` sitting in a hardmacro's declaration is NOT consumed by
    that rung.
