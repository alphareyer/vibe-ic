"""R-0915-86 (1) — the frozen-audit replay, calibrated before it judges.

`audit_replay` re-judges a FROZEN run snapshot with the CURRENT tree's programs.
It is how a JUDGEMENT change — R-0915-85's 23-words-to-5 reform, any audit /
compliance / review change — is measured on r26, run16 and SPM in seconds,
without re-running an EDA tool that may no longer exist.

The subject is fixed (a frozen directory) and the instrument is fixed (one
`flow_compliance_check ... --strict` invocation), so the only variable across two
replays is the TREE. That is the experiment. These tests pin the mechanics of it
with a STUB checker — a five-line program that writes a completion audit — so the
replay's own behaviour is measured rather than the 15,000-line checker's:

  * the snapshot is never modified (the whole premise: it is evidence),
  * the replay reads only a table IT wrote, never one left in the snapshot,
  * a checker that writes nothing REFUSES rather than passing,
  * both calibration directions, per R-0915-86 (3).

The real thing — r26 and run16 replayed with this tree's real checker — is a
MEASUREMENT recorded in the lane's findings. A test that re-runs the real
compliance pass over a 150 MB snapshot is not a test.
