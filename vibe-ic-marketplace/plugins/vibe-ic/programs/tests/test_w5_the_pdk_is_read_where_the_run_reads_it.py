"""W5/15.5ic -- the pad-ring audit asks the container the run's tools use.

THE DEFECT. `phase3_one_shot_runner` passes `--pdk-root` naming a path that
resolves INSIDE the EDA container. Every PDK question in `_pad_ring` was asked of
the HOST, so on a host without that PDK the tree list came back empty,
`IoLibrary.resolved` was False, and `pad_ring_check` refused

    PADRING_MASTERS_UNCORROBORATED -- "no PDK IO cell library resolved, so no
    declared master could be shown to be a PDK cell rather than a drawn shape"

about a run whose own in-container command had returned rc 0. The claim the step
exists to make was reported unverifiable because the audit looked in the wrong
filesystem.

THE SEAM is `_pdk_layer_authority._query`, this tree's one answer to "ask the PDK
where the run's tools are": `reader=None` selects `EDA_CONTAINER` when phase 3
published one and falls back to the local filesystem when it did not, and an
unreachable SELECTED container raises OSError instead of answering "absent".
That last property is the point -- absent is exactly what the old code reported
about a library that was simply somewhere else.
