"""A sign-off DRC zero that NOTHING corroborated is NOT_MEASURED, not clean.

MEASURED on the sha256 sign-off tree (lane rbsha5 / czlecmem — one run, proven
by an identical GDS sha256 — 2026-09-08, plugin v1.19.29, sky130A, image
0.3.49). `reports/phase3/drc_signoff.json` shipped:

    passed true · real_violation_total 0 · has_count FALSE
    tool_corroborated_files 0 · tool_uncorroborated_files 1
    empty_report_files 0 · determined_files 1
    finding: WARNING DRC_VIOLATION_COUNT — No violation count pattern found

The 22 385-byte KLayout RDB it read carries the deck's whole rule list and
ZERO `<item>` and ZERO `<values>` elements. So the design's sign-off DRC was
certified clean from a report that stated no count, that nothing corroborated,
and that is not empty. That is a zero produced by not looking.

DRIVEN ON THE REAL ARTEFACT, both directions, same invocation
(`drc_report_check --mode drc --under reports/phase3/drc_signoff.rpt`):

    clean main   passed True   rc 0
    with the fix passed False  rc 1   DRC_ZERO_NOT_MEASURED

THE EMPTY RULING IS THE CONTROL AND IT MUST NOT MOVE. The 2026-08-30 decision
is that a PRESENT and EMPTY report is a legitimate zero — OpenROAD's
`detailed_route -output_drc` writes a zero-byte file exactly when it found no
residual violation, and collapsing that into "no determinable count" once made
a CLEAN route FAIL. The guard requires `not empty`, so that case is out of its
reach; the third test below is what proves it, and it is the one a careless
widening breaks.
