"""vibe-ic#2126 — the disclosure gate that was PRODUCED and never RUN.

THE DEFECT, MEASURED.  #2091 landed `sta_assumed_clock_disclosure_check`: a
sign-off measured against a clock period the design never stated must say so, in
the record.  The disclosure is stamped into the sign-off records by
`clock_target_provenance.stamp_signoff_records`, and the checker that reads it
back exists and works.  Nothing invoked it.  It was absent from
`phase3_one_shot_runner._DECLARED_SIGNOFF_GATES`, which is the only table any
one-shot runner walks, so no step ran it and no run could refuse on it.  A guard
nothing invokes is not a guard — #2103's shape, one gate later.

Measured on the pre-fix tree (f5a237d21546):

    grep -c sta_assumed_clock_disclosure_check flow/phase1_phase2_phase3.yaml  -> 0
    "sta_assumed_clock_disclosure_check.py" in
        {g[1] for g in phase3_one_shot_runner._DECLARED_SIGNOFF_GATES}         -> False

so the two declaration surfaces the repo has for "this gate runs on every
phase-3 sign-off" both said no.

WHAT THIS FILE ASSERTS, and in which direction.

  (1) DECLARATION, BY NAME.  The gate is in the runner's table and in the flow
      yaml, and the step name it plans reaches `DECLARED_SIGNOFF_STEP_NAMES` and
      the sign-off rollup exactly ONCE.  Every assertion here names the gate;
      none of them counts the population, because a count goes stale for the one
      reason that is never a defect (the population grew) and a substitution
      leaves it undisturbed.

  (2) ORDER, WHICH IS A CORRECTNESS CONSTRAINT HERE.  Two of the three
      `clock_target_provenance.SIGNOFF_RELS` are written by the `sta_signoff`
      and `sta_corner` rows of the same table.  The stamp must therefore run
      after those rows and before this gate reads them.  Placed anywhere else,
      the gate would fail every assumed-period run for the flow's own ordering
      rather than for anything about the design — so the ordering is pinned.

  (3) THE TWO-SIDED CONTROL, on a real project tree and through the real
      `step_declared_signoff_gates`.  A project whose period is ASSUMED reaches
      PASS on the step named `sta_clock_disclosure`; drop the disclosure the
      stamp writes and the SAME step goes FAIL, by name.  A check that cannot
      fail is not a check, and a check that fails on a healthy run is worse.
