"""37.5ic: an unread layer table is not a forbidden layer.

R-0915-126. `tapeout_precheck`'s own arm, `general_precheck`, resolves the PDK
volume once and derives two rungs from it. `--pdk-container` is how a caller
names the container holding that volume, and the flow's clause for this step
carries none, so `container_reader(None)` read the audit HOST.

MEASURED on spm run19, from the run's own `general_precheck.json`:

    volume_read_through   "local"
    volume_tried          ["/foss/pdks/gf180mcuD", "/foss/pdks/gf180mcuD"]
    volume_resolution     "no volume for 'gf180mcuD' in the registry ..."

That directory exists in the image the run recorded and on no host. So the layer
table was unreadable, `General.ForbiddenLayers` went NOT_DETERMINED, the arm went
NOT_DETERMINED, and step 37.5ic FAILed -- over a layout whose 38 layer/datatype
pairs the rung above had just read. Reading the recorded image instead resolves
118 pairs from the technology's own file, and all 38 are inside them.

The decision is SHARED with 15.5ic rather than copied: one
`reader_the_run_recorded` in the module that owns PDK reading. Both directions
are pinned: the recorded image is read when nothing names a container, an
explicit `--pdk-container` still wins, and every way of lacking a trustworthy
receipt keeps the local reader instead of borrowing another image's answer.
