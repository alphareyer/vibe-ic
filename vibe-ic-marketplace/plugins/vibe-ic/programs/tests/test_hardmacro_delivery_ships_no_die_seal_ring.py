"""vibe-ic#2112 — a HARDMACRO delivery must ship no die seal ring.

MEASURED, on a real front-door run of `subservient` (lane rbsub4, 2026-09-07,
pinned EDA image 0.3.48, gf180mcuD). The design declared
`deliverable = HARDMACRO` and the flow's own step 0.5ic AGREED, in as many
words: "it is delivered, not fabricated, so it terminates at the hardmacro kit
and needs no pad ring, seal ring or submission check". A later step then
derived the opposite from a TOOL CAPABILITY — "the technology ships a die
seal-ring generator ... a die in a process whose own sign-off tech tree carries
a die-seal generator carries the ring it builds" — published
`seal_ring_required=true` into the declaration, and die finishing stamped a die
seal ring into the SHIPPED GDS.

The ring brought a die-sized guard-ring marker with it, so the sign-off deck
evaluated the whole routed design as guard-ring metal. Measured over the run's
own KLayout RDB, summing <multiplicity> per <category>:

    TOTAL 1359528   GR.4 1299340   GR.2 24652   GR.6 1022
    GR.* family = 1325014 = 97.46%   |   everything else = 34514

The premise of that derivation is "a die". A hardmacro is placed INSIDE
somebody else's die, and that parent die owns the ring and the die-level
markers. `_tapeout_declaration` has said so since it was written — every
question of section 2C is `required_for=(DELIVERABLE_DIE,)` — and until this
fix neither the producer nor the derivation read `deliverable` back.

TWO GUARDS, and both are pinned here:
  * `die_finishing_gen._hardmacro_skip` — the producer. It is what actually
    stops the ring being GENERATED, and it holds even when the declaration
    carries no section-2C answer at all (which is the state the run was in
    before the derivation wrote one).
  * `phase3_one_shot_runner._declared_seal_ring_required` — the derivation,
    refused one step earlier at the point where the wrong premise was taken.

Both directions are proved: declare DIE and the same tree gets past the guard.
