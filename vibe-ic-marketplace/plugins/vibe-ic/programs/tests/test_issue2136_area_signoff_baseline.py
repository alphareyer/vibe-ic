"""vibe-ic#2136 — a standard-cell area ceiling measured on ONE technology must
not judge a run built on another; it must resolve per technology or refuse by
name.

Measured (lane rbsub4, confirmed unchanged by rbsub5): an L7 verification plan
states its baseline WITH its attribution --

    ### 7.4.1 Baseline (top=..., sky130_fd_sc_hd, TT corner)
    | stdcell area | **12,775 um^2** |

-- and then turns it into an absolute sign-off row that carries NO attribution
at all:

    | stdcell area | (0, baseline x 1.3] = <= 16,608 um^2 | gate |

The same design directed onto gf180mcuD mapped to 57,024.71 um^2 (2180 cells).
Against that row it is a 3.4x overshoot; against the row's own denominator it
is not a comparison at all. The lane declined to report pass/fail and said so.

BOTH DIRECTIONS ARE ASSERTED HERE, deliberately:
  * the run on the baseline's OWN technology must reproduce 16,608 with its
    source cited -- a fix that refuses everything is not a fix; and
  * the run on another technology must read NOT_DETERMINED BY NAME, never PASS
    and never FAIL, and must become judgeable again the moment a baseline
    measured in its OWN cell library exists.

THE MUTATION IS RUN HERE TOO: disabling the attribution test is exactly the
"fall back to the other technology's literal" defect, and the test asserts the
mutant reproduces 16,608 for the other technology while the shipped code does
not. A check that cannot fail is not a check.
