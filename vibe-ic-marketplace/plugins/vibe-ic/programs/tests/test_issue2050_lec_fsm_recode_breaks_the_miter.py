"""Regression for #2050 — `synth`'s FSM re-encoding makes the LEC recipe build
an INCONSISTENT miter, and the gate then blamed induction depth for it.

MEASURED, opentitan_aes x sky130A, image sha256:06537f7e8d3c, plugin v1.17.72:

  * `synth` runs `fsm`, whose `fsm_recode` pass re-assigns FSM state encodings.
    19 of 19 extracted FSMs were recoded to one-hot; the state registers changed
    BOTH encoding and width (e.g. a 3-bit sparse `...u_prim_alert_sender.state_q`
    became a 7-bit one-hot register).
  * `equiv_make` matches key points BY NAME and has its OWN guard for this: it
    SKIPS a signal whose gold and gate widths differ.  `splitnets -ports`
    DEFEATS that guard — despite the flag name it splits internal signals too
    (internal-only is the default; `-ports` means "and ports as well"), so
    equiv_make no longer sees 3 bits against 7, it sees `state_q[0..2]` on each
    side and matches them POSITIONALLY.  Those pairs are not the same signal.
  * Forcing them equal makes the miter's key-point set inconsistent, and
    `equiv_induct`'s base case — `ez->assume(all unproven key points equal at
    steps 1..k); ez->solve()` — goes UNSAT: `Circuit inherently diverges!`.
    ONE poisoned pair aborts the induction for the WHOLE design: 3242 points
    across every block were left unproven by 3 recoded registers in one alert
    sender.
  * A/B on the SAME prepared design (only the named flag varies):
      splitnets + no encfile  : 4072 points,  676 proven, base case UNSAT at step 2
      no splitnets            : 4012 points, 1483 proven, base case HOLDS
      + `equiv_make -encfile` : 4087 points, 4056 proven / 31 unproven, 1068 s
    and, on a ~50-line design that reproduces the SAME SIGNATURE — a sparse,
    Hamming-separated FSM whose state flop lives in a submodule, so the recoded
    signal is `u_state_regs.u_state_flop.q_o` exactly as in the real design:
      RED   (recipe as shipped): three equiv_induct rungs, byte-identical output,
             all three `Proof for base case failed. Circuit inherently diverges!`
             at step 2 -> 9 points, 2 proven, 7 unproven
      GREEN (`synth -encfile` + `equiv_make -encfile`): "Creating encoder/decoder
             for signal u_state_regs.u_state_flop.q_o." -> 10/10, "Equivalence
             successfully proven!"
  * Adding `-encfile` to synth leaves the netlist BYTE-IDENTICAL (same sha256 on
    opentitan_aes and on fsmtop) — it only records the translation.

Two defects are fixed here:
  (1) build_equiv_script could not consume an encoding translation at all, and
      unconditionally emitted the `splitnets -ports` that defeats equiv_make's
      width guard;
  (2) the gate reported the base-case-UNSAT shape as "a disclosed
      sequential-depth capability gap ... close with sign-off LEC, which handles
      deep sequential induction", and justified it with "a real difference
      produces a counterexample".  SCOPED CLAIM, and the scope is the point: the
      gate also reads non-yosys LEC reports, where a real counterexample count
      CAN arrive and the guard is meaningful.  On the YOSYS path it cannot:
      lec_run.py hardcodes `non_equivalent_points` to 0 (its own comment says "a
      genuine difference surfaces as `unproven`"), and no pass in yosys's
      passes/equiv emits any counterexample phrase.  So on the path this design
      took, the sentence told the reader that 0 counterexamples meant something,
      from a field that could never be anything else.

literal, and no design name is required by any assertion below.

#: WHERE A REAL YOSYS IS, AND WHY THIS IS NOT A SKIP.
#:
#: Four tests in this file drive a REAL yosys, because a recipe asserted only as
#: a STRING cannot show that the SAT actually proves the points -- which is the
#: whole argument of #2050 and must not be downgraded to a text comparison.
#:
#: MEASURED on main 800cecb34 (8HD-8, a bare PATH; the tools live in the pinned
#: image): `test_empty_encoding_table_preserves_scalarized_register_proofs`
#: called `subprocess.run(["yosys", ...])` with nothing resolved and died
#: `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] ... 'yosys'` -- a missing INSTALL reported as a
#: claim about the CODE.
#:
#: AND THE ANSWER IS NOT A SKIP. A skip on the measuring host turns a test that
#: CANNOT RUN into a green line, which is the same lie in the other direction;
#: the sibling `test_scalar_data_and_recoded_fsm_real_yosys` did exactly that,
#: and it is why a real #2050 failure sat unseen on main behind a `2 skipped`.
#: So the test RESOLVES yosys the way `lec_run` itself does and measures
#: WHEREVER THE PROGRAM CAN RUN:
#:
#:   1. this filesystem, if `yosys` is on PATH -- which is the case INSIDE the
#:      image, where the plugin's own suite and an in-image flow run live;
#:   2. otherwise the pinned EDA container the flow dispatches into, named by
#:      `lec_run.DEFAULT_CONTAINER` (`_eda_pin.default_container_name()`, so
#:      `VIBEIC_EDA_CONTAINER` is honoured exactly as everywhere else).
#:
#: HOST FIRST is not a preference: it is what makes one test correct in both
#: environments, and it is the order `digital_hardmacro_gen.MagicSite`,
#: `_klayout_launch.find_runner` and `analog_pdk_deck_context.container_reader`
#: already follow.
#:
#: NO SECOND RESOLVER AND NO SECOND EXEC. Every container touch below is
#: `lec_run`'s own: `_container_available`, `_yosys_version`,
#: `_container_file_exists`, and `_docker`, whose first argument IS the
#: host/container switch (`container in ("", "host")` runs here, anything else
#: is a `docker exec`). So the test launches yosys through the same call the
#: program launches it through.
#:
#: AND IF NEITHER ROUTE REACHES IT, THE TEST FAILS -- naming NOT_MEASURED and
#: both routes it tried. A test that cannot measure says so as a failure.

          about the code that the run never made. That is how

          not a tool guard, not "just while the tool is missing". A skip on the
          measuring host turns a test that CANNOT RUN into a green line, and a
          green line is what a reader counts. This file's own history is the
          argument: `test_scalar_data_and_recoded_fsm_real_yosys` skipped on
          every bare-PATH host, and a REAL #2050 failure sat behind that
          `2 skipped` for as long as nobody ran the suite in the image.
      (3) NO SECOND RESOLVER. `lec_run.DEFAULT_CONTAINER` and `lec_run._docker`
          are how the PROGRAM finds and launches yosys; a test that grew its own
          copy would be free to disagree with the program about where the tool
          is, which is the class `digital_hardmacro_gen.MagicSite` was written
