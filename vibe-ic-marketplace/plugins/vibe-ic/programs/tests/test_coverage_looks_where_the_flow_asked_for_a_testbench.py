"""The coverage build must look in the directory this flow's own gate demands a
testbench in.

MEASURED 2026-09-15 (lane icsub2) on `subservient` x gf180mcuD. Two programs in
one flow, disagreeing about where a testbench lives::

    rtl_unit_test_coverage_check   ->  rc 1
        missing_unit_tb  subservient.v
        expected_tb      sim_unit/tb_subservient.v
        reasons          FSM pattern `case (state)`, `reg [N:0] state`
        message          "See rtl-unit-testbench-gen SKILL.md"

    verilator_coverage_measure._TB_DISCOVERY_ORDER
        phase2/stage1/sim_full_stack/tb_*_oracle.v
        phase2/stage1/sim_full_stack/tb_*_full.v
        phase2/stage1/sim/tb/*.v            <-- and nothing else

so the flow ASKED FOR the one testbench that could move the design and then
looked everywhere except where it had asked for it. What the coverage build
found instead, in `verilator_coverage_measure check`'s own words::

    NO FUNCTIONAL STIMULUS IN THE COVERAGE BUILD -- this run measured no
    coverage of the design ... of the signal(s) it binds to the design and
    declares drivable it assigns only ['i_clk','i_rst'] -- the clock and reset.
    It never drives ['i_sram_data'], so the design's inputs were never moved.
    ... the recorded percentages (line 45.19%, toggle 34.76%, branch 43.75%)
    describe that testbench, NOT the RTL.

Every candidate the three entries could reach was inert: the `sim_full_stack`
harness declares itself connectivity-only and all ten `sim/tb/*.v` are the
generator's SUBSTANCE FLOOR shape, each carrying `VIBEIC_TB_ORACLE: NONE`.

WHAT IT COST, end to end, and what it buys once the two lists are one list --
measured over the real design with `verilator --binary --timing --coverage-*`
in the pinned image and parsed by this module's own `parse_coverage_dat`::

    scoped to the RTL        before          after
    line                     45.19 %         80.74 %   (109/135)
    toggle                   34.76 %         93.55 %   (1639/1752)
    branch                   43.75 %         91.67 %   (44/48)

    verilator_coverage_measure check   blocking floor 70/60/70   FAIL -> PASS
    coverage_closure                   goal 80 %                 FAIL -> PASS

THE ENTRY IS LAST, AND THAT IS THE DESIGN. `_TB_DISCOVERY_ORDER` is
most-authoritative-first and a per-module unit TB is not what the flow
simulates for its functional verdict, so it must not displace an oracle. It is
reachable because the selection already prefers whichever candidate
DEMONSTRABLY DRIVES A FUNCTIONAL INPUT -- this change adds a place to look, not
a new preference rule, and the two tests below pin both halves of that.

chip-AGNOSTIC: generic `dut` / `tb_*` fixtures, no design, PDK or vendor token.
