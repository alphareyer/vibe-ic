"""R-0915-36: a layer's applicability is DECIDED FROM THE INPUT, not assumed.

MEASURED 2026-09-15 (lane icspm3) on `spm` x gf180mcuD. L24 and L25 were both
emitted as::

    "applicability": "APPLICABLE", "extraction_status": "NOT_YET_EXTRACTED",
    every field null

and their two P0 gates reported, honestly, that there was nothing to certify.
A skeleton in that state has declared NOTHING -- it says the subject matters
and that nobody looked -- so the gates stayed INCOMPLETE, permanently, no
matter what the design was.

`emit_l_doc_skeleton` now asks the input first, for the layers registered in
`_INPUT_SUBJECT_TERMS`. No input document carrying the layer's subject means
the layer is emitted as a DECLARED ABSENCE (`applicability: NOT_APPLICABLE`,
`extraction_status: DECLARED_ABSENT_FROM_INPUT`) carrying the documents it
scanned and the terms it searched. Any input document carrying the subject
leaves the layer exactly as it is today.

THAT SECOND DIRECTION IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS, and spm supplies it live: the
design's own input DOES discuss sign-off -- 8 occurrences of "sign-off", 5 of
DRC, 4 of LVS, 3 of STA, plus antenna and tapeout, across five documents -- so
L24 stays APPLICABLE and `l24_signoff_evidence_backed_check` keeps blocking.
Its skeleton is a real phase-1 extraction gap. L25's subject appears in ZERO
of the nine documents, so L25 becomes the declared absence.

The terms are not invented: each is a word the layer's own
`_extraction_hints_for()` already uses, and that is pinned below so the table
cannot drift from what the layer says it is looking for.
