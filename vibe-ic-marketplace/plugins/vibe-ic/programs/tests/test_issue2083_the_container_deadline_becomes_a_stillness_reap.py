"""vibe-ic#2083 (owner ruling, 2026-09-07) — the second half.

Fixing the false stall alone still left the hard macro un-produced, for an
independent reason. `digital_hardmacro_gen` spent ONE `timeout_s` (default 900)
two different ways:

  * host path, l.1111: `run_host_supervised(stall_grace_s=float(timeout_s))`
    — a STALL GRACE. A magic that keeps computing is never stopped.
  * container path — the one a flow run actually takes — via
    `_container_exec.run_in_container(deadline_s=timeout_s)`:
        docker exec <c> timeout -k 5 900 bash -lc 'magic …'
    — a HARD WALL CLOCK inside the container, booked as
    `magic did not complete: the 900s deadline expired`.

MEASURED (8HD-8, image sha256:8c5694ab / 0.3.48): that extraction, run with
nothing in front of it, takes **5187.5 s** at a steady 1.000 CPU-second per
second and finishes cleanly — exit 0, `DIGITAL_LEF_WRITE_DONE`, a 21494-byte
abstract with 84 pins. The 900 s deadline lands at **17.4%** of the job. So the
step was cutting healthy tools in half and reporting the cut as the tool's own
failure.

The ruling: convert the site to the supervised shape — identity stamp then
`exec`, NO outer clock — reaped only on STILLNESS and only BY IDENTITY, with
the old value kept as a RECORDED ceiling. The orphan contract the deadline
existed for is kept and sharpened: a still tool is reaped where it lives, a
computing one is never cut.

These tests hold every load-bearing half of that, and the register clause that
makes putting the clock back a RED.
