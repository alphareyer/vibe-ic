"""A gate is asked where its declared input CAN exist, and not earlier.

MEASURED on subservient x gf180mcuD r48 (`_lane_icsub2/c24_proj`), a phase-2-only
run. The P0 umbrella runs in the phase-2 audit, and it asked
`spice_correlation_check` — a gate whose subject is step 22's extracted `*.spef`
and step 23's STA reports, BOTH phase-3 artefacts. The gate answered honestly and
self-skipped, and the prose recogniser booked that skip as an upstream failure::

    BLOCKED: spice_correlation_check — reason_class=BLOCKED_BY_UPSTREAM:
      examined nothing (reason: no_spef); this is NOT a pass over the design

`BLOCKED_BY_UPSTREAM` is not skip-eligible, so a question asked before its answer
could exist kept step P0 non-green on every digital design at once.

ASKED EARLY IS ITS OWN CLASS, AND THE TREE ALREADY HAD IT. R-0915-46/47's
`ASKED_BEFORE_PRODUCER` is exactly this state — "the gate ran, found its subject
absent, and the thing that PRODUCES that subject has not run yet in this flow" —
and it IS skip-eligible, narrowly: granted only while the tree shows the producer
has not run, and never once it has. `spice_correlation_check` simply was not in
`_GATE_SUBJECT_PRODUCED_BY`; the two gates that were are `klayout_deck_mode_check`
and `gate_evidence_completeness_check`.

THE DISCRIMINATOR IS THE PRODUCER'S OWN DECLARED INPUT, NOT ITS OUTPUT. Keying
the predicate on "is there a SPEF" would have said "the producer has not run" of a
producer that ran and FAILED — the opposite finding, and the one case that must
stay BLOCKED_BY_UPSTREAM. So it reads step 22's `required_inputs` entry,
`phase3/stage3/pnr/routed.def` from step 21: absent, extraction was never
reachable; present, it was, and an absent SPEF is a real upstream failure.

THE GATE IS STILL INVOKED, deliberately. Its row stays in P0's population as a
disclosed skip. Removing it from the invoked set would make
`_structural_measurement_line` report PARTIAL — "what those N audit is UNCHECKED
— not clean" — and shrinking `registered` to avoid that would be narrowing a
population to green a row.

chip-AGNOSTIC: paths come from `_path_layout` and from the shipped flow
definition; no chip, PDK or vendor literal appears here.
