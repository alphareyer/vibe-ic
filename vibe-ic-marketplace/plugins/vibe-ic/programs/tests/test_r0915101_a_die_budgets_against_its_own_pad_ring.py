"""R-0915-101: on a DIE the slot budget IS the die's own pad ring, and it DECIDES.

MEASURED on subservient x gf180mcuD, two runs of the SAME design against the
SAME input (benchmark-data 8e436ceb, DIE, owner-attested):

  r46, tree a8c7a3e74 -- the gate answered `NOT_APPLICABLE` /
      `DESIGN_DECLARED_NA`: it fell through to the HARDMACRO route ("nobody's
      slot, so no budget"). Skip-eligible, so flow step 2 PASSed. That is the
      laundering `test_issue2277
      ::test_a_DIE_against_the_same_catalogue_still_gets_a_real_verdict`
      forbids.

  r47, tree 8efd02930 -- the DIE branch landed and now outranks that route, so
      the die is no longer exempt. But with `pad_signal_map` NOT_DETERMINED it
      answered `UNDECIDED` / `BLOCKED_BY_UPSTREAM`, which is not skip-eligible,
      so `flow_compliance_check` booked step 2
      `FAIL -- INCOMPLETE: the gate reports its input was applicable and was
      NOT examined`, step 4's 10/10 L10 oracles were voided as
      `dependency [2] = FAIL`, and Overall went `NOT_MEASURED`. Every digital
      IC on the IC path sat behind that one gate.

Neither answer is a verdict about this design's pad budget, and the design was
not silent about its pad ring either time: it states it in the pad-placement
section of its own external-interface document, which is exactly where
`io_pad_chip_top_gen` derives `pad_order_by_side` and `SIGNAL_MAP` from at step
15.5ic. R-0915-101 rules that the phase-2 budget must derive from that SAME
source and DECIDE.

THE READER IS ONE READER. `_l_doc_pad_placement.derive_own_ring` is what both
steps call, so a phase-2 budget and a phase-3 ring cannot disagree about which
pad carries which net. Measured on the r47 project copy: the step-2 gate
derives 31 signal pads and r46's phase-3 `io_pad_chip_top.json` recorded 31
signal pad instances (33 total, less the 2 supply pads).

WHAT IS STILL UNDECIDABLE, AND IS A FINDING BY NAME. A die that declares no
top-level port, and a die that states its ring in NEITHER place it may be
stated, are design-input gaps. They are booked `ZERO_DENOMINATOR` with a named
finding -- never `BLOCKED_BY_UPSTREAM`, which would send the reader to an
upstream step that generates the ring FROM the declaration the design did not
write.
