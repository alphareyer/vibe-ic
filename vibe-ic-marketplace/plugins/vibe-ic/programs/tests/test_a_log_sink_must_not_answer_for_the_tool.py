"""`tee` answered for the tool, and one PnR failure was reported as a
power-grid audit gap.

The defect
----------
Every long tool run in `phase3_one_shot_runner` is composed as

    <tool> ... 2>&1 | tee <log>

and a shell pipeline's exit status is the LAST command's. `tee` succeeds
whenever it can write its file, so the TOOL's status never reaches the runner.
Eleven such pipelines exist in that one file — openroad (PnR, RC extraction,
IR/EM, antenna, metal fill, ERC, …), OpenSTA, yosys and magic.

MEASURED, through the exact wrapper the module uses
(`docker exec -e IIC_OSIC_TOOLS_QUIET=1 <c> bash -lc <cmd>`), OpenROAD
26Q3-1066-g29e3e63e45 on a design whose netlist it cannot parse:

    openroad -no_init -exit t.tcl 2>&1 | tee /tmp/or.log        ->  rc 0
    set -o pipefail; openroad ... 2>&1 | tee /tmp/or.log        ->  rc 1
    set -o pipefail; <same command, on a design that links>     ->  rc 0

The third line is the negative control: `pipefail` does not manufacture
failures, it stops discarding them.

What it cost on a real run
--------------------------
`openroad -no_init -exit pnr.tcl` aborted after 15 s with

    [ERROR STA-0171] .../<top>_synth.v line 1293425, syntax error
    Error: pnr.tcl, 8 STA-0171

`step_pnr`'s completion test is `if rc != 0 or not def_file.is_file()`. `rc`
was 0 because of `tee`, and `def_file.is_file()` was satisfied by a DEF left
by an EARLIER run — so both halves of the test passed on a run that placed and
routed nothing. The step was reported as

    BLOCKED pnr  PG_NET_OWNERSHIP_UNMEASURED

a power-grid audit gap, with `duration_s: 15.05` in the orchestrator record.
The next reader spent a session on the power grid.

This is the same class as the provenance version probe that read `head`'s
status instead of the tool's: *a downstream filter answered for the tool.*
That was fixed at one site. This fixes it at the one place every container
command passes through, so the twelfth pipeline cannot reintroduce it.

Scope
-----
Only a pipeline into `tee`. `tee` is a pure logging sink; it never expresses a
decision, so its exit status is never the answer. Pipelines into
`head`/`grep`/`awk` are untouched — there the filter's status can legitimately
be the question.
