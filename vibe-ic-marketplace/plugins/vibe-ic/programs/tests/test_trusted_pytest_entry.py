#: THE REFERENCE IS COMPOSED, NOT COPIED (vibe-ic#2100).
#:
#: This was the literal `ghcr.io/vibeic/vibeic-eda@sha256:8c5694…`, which welds
#: the pinned DIGEST (identity) to a REPOSITORY (deployment configuration).  The
#: digest half is a second definition of the pin; the repository half is simply
#: wrong on any host that reaches the same bytes elsewhere.
#:
#: MEASURED 2026-09-07 on 8HD-4 with `VIBEIC_EDA_IMAGE_REPO` exported: the
#: pinned bytes were present under the configured repository and absent under
#: `ghcr.io`, so `docker image inspect` failed and
#: `test_image_entry_ignores_subject_shadow` reported
#: "exact hermetic landing image is not locally available" — a SKIP, in
#: pytest's green bucket, on every host that carries the fleet configuration.
#: The one test that proves the landing runtime cannot be shadowed inside the
#: image had quietly stopped running there, and nothing said so.
#:
#: `_eda_pin` is a different module from the subject (`trusted_pytest_entry`),
#: so reading it here is not circular; it is the same composition every other
#: run-path site performs.
#:
#: RESOLVED WHEN THE TEST RUNS, NOT AT COLLECTION (lane rfimg2). This was
#: `IMAGE = _pin.image_reference()` at module level, which asks THIS HOST's
#: docker: inside the image (no docker) the whole file was a collection error,
#: so the eleven tests here that need no image at all never ran either.

#: write the PARENT's nonce from a different pid, and the driver fails the
#: parent's whole session with `schema/nonce/pid mismatch` — the file's result
#: becomes UNKNOWN even though every test in it passed. MEASURED on the

    name match was the first shape and it is a guess about two spellings: it
    silently returns an INCOMPLETE lane on any installation that adds a
    directory under some other name, or one a `.pth` file injected.

    BOTH ARMS RUN WITHOUT `PYTHONPATH`/`PYTHONHOME`, and that is load-bearing
    rather than tidy. `-I` implies `-E`, so the siteless arm cannot honour them
    and the ordinary arm can -- an asymmetry that puts every ambient entry into
    the difference as though site processing had added it. MEASURED: under the
    landing arm, `pytest_per_file_junit` prepends the plugin's own `programs`
    directory to `PYTHONPATH` for every child it spawns, so the lane came out
    naming a directory INSIDE the checkout and `trusted_pytest_entry` refused
    it -- `VIBEIC_TRUSTED_PYTEST_SITE resolved inside the subject checkout`.
    The entry's guard was right; the lane this helper built was wrong.

    Anything inside the repository is dropped for that same reason. The entry
    OWNS that refusal and keeps it; this is a builder obeying the contract it
    builds for, not a second copy of the check. An editable install pointing at
    the checkout would otherwise reintroduce exactly the failure above on a host
    that happens to have one.

    The difference is also what makes the ordering assertion sound: none of

    """A lane naming ONLY the runner's own directory must get the verdict that
    directory actually deserves -- refusal when something is missing, a record
    when nothing is -- and never a refusal papered over by reaching past it.

    WHY THIS IS NOT `if the closure spans one directory`. It was, and that guard
    was wrong. MEASURED on two hosts of this fleet at the same commit:

        8HD-d  runner dir  ~/.local/lib/python3.12/site-packages
               pygments lives in /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages, so the runner
               dir alone is INSUFFICIENT and the entry refuses.       rc 2
        8HD-7  runner dir  ~/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages
               which already holds everything that session imports, so the
               runner dir alone is SUFFICIENT and the entry records.  rc 0

    Both hosts have a three-directory closure by the `os.pathsep` count, so
    counting directories predicted a refusal on 8HD-7 that could not happen
    there and the test failed on the orchestrator host while passing here --
    which is the host-dependent gate this repository refuses to ship.

    REPRODUCED on 8HD-d before rewriting it, by building a runner directory that
    holds the whole closure and pointing the lane at that alone: the entry
    records, `1 passed`, rc 0 -- 8HD-7's shape, on this host, from the same
    entry. So the ENTRY was never wrong; the guard was measuring a proxy.

    The property is SUFFICIENCY, and sufficiency is measured, not counted:
    `_session_without_the_entry` runs the same interpreter, subject and
    environment with that one directory on `sys.path` and no entry at all. What
    is asserted is that the entry's verdict AGREES with it, which is a real
    claim in both directions:

      control fails, entry records  ->  the entry reached past the lane it was
                                        given, which is the silent fallback
                                        `trusted_pytest_entry`'s own docstring
                                        refuses. THE DEFECT THIS TEST IS FOR.
      control records, entry fails  ->  the entry refuses a runtime that works.

    and on a host whose runner directory is insufficient it additionally pins
    that the refusal names the SAME cause the control hit, rather than a generic
    one.

# holding `argparse.py` does not add a runner, it REPLACES a stdlib module for
# every import that follows -- including the runner's own. MEASURED on 8HD-9 at
# live main a003990aef, this module against clean main:

#   [NORECORD] trusted pytest entry: ArgumentParser.__init__() got an

#
#   4 failed, 8 passed, 2 skipped
#
# `argparse 1.4.0` (a PyPI backport predating `allow_abbrev`) sits in that
# host's user site; `import pytest` two lines after the front-insert reaches
# `_pytest.config.argparsing`, which builds `ArgumentParser(allow_abbrev=...)`
# against the shadow. The tier was already honest -- `[NORECORD]`, rc 2, never
# a pass -- but the REASON named a keyword in a file the reader would then go
# and read for nothing. The entry had never measured WHICH module was shadowed,
# so it could not say. 4 test ids, ONE root cause.
#
# These pin the repair: the entry MEASURES the lane's top level against
# `sys.stdlib_module_names` and refuses BY NAME. Nothing is relaxed -- the
