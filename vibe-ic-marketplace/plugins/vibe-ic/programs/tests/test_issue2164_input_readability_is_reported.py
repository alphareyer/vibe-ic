"""Regression for #2164 (1 of 3) — an unreadable design input is a named
NOT_MEASURED at the point of use, never an empty query.

THE DEFECT, MEASURED ON THE PUBLISHED CORPUS. `input_text` returned a string
and nothing else. A project whose entire design input is a PDF returned `""` —
byte-identical to a project with no `input/` tree at all, and to one whose
files are genuinely empty. That empty string was then handed to
`ic_expert_db_query.query` as a retrieval QUERY and to the AI sub-track as a
PROMPT, and every consumer read what came back as a measurement. FOURTEEN
published corpus projects are in that state today, every one of them
classified, across five registered classes — ten `digital_arithmetic_primitive`
plus one each of `serial_peripheral_protocol`, `digital_cmd_driven`,
`pure_analog` and `processor_cpu`. All fourteen hold exactly one `.pdf`.

AND THE COUNT IS WHY THE CENSUS EXISTS. That figure was carried by hand as
"12 across five classes" through two commit messages of the lane that found it.
It was 14. A population nobody can re-derive with one command is a population
that drifts, so `--input-readability` prints it per project and the corpus
figure is a loop, not a memory.

FIVE STATES, because four of them used to be the same empty string:
  READ / NO_INPUT_TREE / NO_FILES_AT_ALL / UNREADABLE_FORMAT / READ_AND_EMPTY
and the one distinction the whole change turns on is the last against the
fourth: "I read it and it was empty" is a fact about the DESIGN and may be
reported as a zero; "I could not open it" is a fact about the READER and may
not.
