"""Tests for gate_directed_rtl_repair.py — the loop that ACTS on a blocking
gate's own verdict instead of shipping nothing.

The load-bearing test here is NOT "the repair works". It is
`test_candidate_that_still_fails_is_discarded`: the whole design rests on the
claim that acceptance comes from an INDEPENDENT MEASURING oracle, so a candidate
that applies cleanly and COMPILES but still does not reproduce the spec's
disclosed trace must be thrown away. If that test ever goes green for the wrong
reason, the loop is free to ship broken RTL under a green gate — strictly worse
than the honest rejection it replaced.

The statement-scanner tests pin the corpus-sweep defect: a first cut used a
regex for `<=` and read the COMPARISON in `if (cnt <= 5)` as an assignment,
corrupting 24 of 6265 corpus RTL files.
