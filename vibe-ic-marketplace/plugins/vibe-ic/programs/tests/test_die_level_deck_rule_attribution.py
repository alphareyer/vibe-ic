"""vibe-ic#2112 — the DRC summary must ATTRIBUTE die-level deck rules.

MEASURED, lane cz2112 on 8HD-6, pinned EDA image 0.3.48, gf180mcuD (an open
PDK), the `subservient` layout of the rbsub4 front-door run. The SAME routed
DEF, streamed and grid-snapped by the flow's own scripts, then run through the
PDK's own sign-off deck twice:

    a die seal ring stamped in   1,359,528 violations   GR.4 1,299,340
    no ring                              5 violations   GR.*         0

So on that delivery the sign-off DRC total was not a statement about the
layout: 97.5% of it was three rules of ONE deck file, and those three rules are
gated on the die-level marker layer the ring's generator drew over the die.

`die_finishing_gen._hardmacro_skip` is what stops the ring being generated.
This module is the disclosure half: whenever such a rule fires anyway on a
HARDMACRO delivery, the DRC step's summary says so instead of folding the count
into the design's number.

WHICH RULES ARE DIE-LEVEL IS READ OUT OF THE PDK'S OWN DECK, never listed here.
The two deck fragments below are verbatim from that image, and they are what
pins the two link shapes the module accepts.
