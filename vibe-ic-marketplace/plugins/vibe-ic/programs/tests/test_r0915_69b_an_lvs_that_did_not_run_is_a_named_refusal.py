"""R-0915-69(b) — LVS did not run, and step 31 said it could not find a report.

MEASURED, sha256 x sky130A, lane icsha2 run15 (main 385445351), front door.

`reports/phase3/lvs_verdict.json`, written by the flow itself:

    "status":  "FAIL",
    "finding": "LVS_EXTRACTION_ILLEGAL_OVERLAP",
    "message": "Magic's extraction feedback channel did not clear the
                zero-illegal-overlap gate (rc=1): ... netgen was NOT run — a
                compare against a netlist the extractor could not decide is not
                evidence about this design."

`steps/phase3/stage3/31_.../lvs.json`, written by the audit over the same tree:

    "rule": "LVS_REPORT_EXISTS",
    "message": "No LVS report found (searched *lvs*.rpt/log, *comp*.out)",
    "summary": {"files_found": 0}

Two artefacts about the same event, in the same directory, and the one that
reaches the verdict is the one that says nothing.  The refusal is CORRECT — a
netlist the extractor could not decide must not be compared — it is the naming
that failed, twice:

  * the runner filed a no-compare under `status: FAIL`, a word that claims a
    compare happened and disagreed;
  * `_lvs_blocked_verdict` honours the artifact only on a literal `BLOCKED`, so
    it returned None and the audit fell through to an unattributed absence.
