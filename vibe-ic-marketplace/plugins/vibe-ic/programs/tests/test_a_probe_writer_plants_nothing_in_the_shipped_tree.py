"""A test that plants a probe in the shipped tree races every test that reads it.

THE DEFECT (8HD-8 stacked census, 2026-09-28). `test_issue559`'s growth-hole
test wrote `programs/brand_new_hand_rolled_check.py`, measured, and unlinked it
in a `finally`. Under xdist, `test_upstream_mirror_is_pinned::
test_the_shipped_tree_is_clean` listed programs/*.py while the probe existed and
read it after the unlink: `FileNotFoundError`, a red on a test that is correct.
Lane rfrace fixed twelve writers of this shape on 2026-09-27; this one was
missed because its write sat inside a helper whose parameter is named
`tmp_path`, and the caller passed the SHIPPED programs dir as that argument.

WHY A NEW TEST IS NEEDED AT ALL. `suite_write_guard` compares `git status`
snapshots and states its own bound: "a write made AND reverted inside a single
test is invisible to a snapshot taken after it". A probe writer that cleans up
is exactly that write, so the guard printed `[PASS] ... wrote nothing` over
every one of these on origin/main. The race is the only symptom, and a race
is a symptom nobody reproduces on demand.

WHAT THIS DOES. It re-runs each former writer in a child pytest under
`_tree_write_audit`, which records the WRITE itself (an audit hook in every
Python process of the child), and requires both that the node PASSED -- a node
that did not run proves nothing about what it writes -- and that it wrote
nothing under the checkout. Moving any of them back into the shipped tree is
then a named red here instead of an intermittent one somewhere else.

Each entry names what the node wrote on origin/main 76a277544, measured with
the same hook.
