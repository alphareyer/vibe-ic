"""The LEC ladder runs ONE RUNG PER PROCESS, so its ceiling stops being the SUM.

THE MEASURED FACT THIS SUITE IS BUILT ON (vibe-ic#2194). opentitan_aes's LEC was
OOM-killed at a 48 GiB cgroup cap — `OOMKilled=true`, `HostConfig.Memory=
51539607552`, `memory.events oom_kill 1` — while the very rung that died reaches
frame 18 with the SAME 57873326 clauses and 22024817 variables at 16.3 GB and
`oom_kill 0` when it is the ONLY rung in the process. 48 GiB was therefore never
that rung's footprint; it was the LADDER'S ACCUMULATION across rungs in one
address space.

Raising the ceiling is not the repair: a bigger number buys exactly one more
rung and hits the same wall — a limit moved to fit the job it just failed, the
shape #2177 forbids. A ladder whose memory grows with the NUMBER OF RUNGS can
only be sized for a machine, and then only until the next design.

WHAT THESE TESTS PIN, each one a direction the change could go wrong in:

  * the ladder can be BOUNDED to one rung, and with no bound its text is
    BYTE-IDENTICAL to the pre-#2194 emission (so the whole-ladder path stays a
    control and not a re-implementation of one);
  * the driver launches ONE PROCESS PER RUNG, each reading the previous rung's
    checkpoint — the mutation that restores the single-process ladder is what
    this catches;
  * THE PROOF STATE CROSSES THE BOUNDARY. A restart from a checkpoint that had
    lost the proven set would redo the work and look exactly like progress, so
    the carry is MEASURED at every boundary — and the measurement is proven to
    go RED when the set is lost, not merely green when it is kept;
  * a rung that genuinely exceeds the ceiling STILL FAILS: the ladder stops at
    it, says so, re-attempts nothing, and never reports a PASS;
  * a figure that could not be read is NOT_MEASURED (None) and never a 0.
