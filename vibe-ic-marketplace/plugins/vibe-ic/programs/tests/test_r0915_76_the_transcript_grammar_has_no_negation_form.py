"""R-0915-76 — the polarity argument for `sdf_gate_sim::_run_l10_suite`, measured.

`prose_polarity_consulted_check` flagged `_run_l10_suite` as a prose extractor
that reads a value out of a sentence and writes it as a declaration without
asking whether the sentence DENIES it.  What it actually reads out of a
gate-level transcript is SIMULATOR AND SHELL DIAGNOSTIC GRAMMAR:

    RC=(\\d+)                                  the deck's own `echo RC=$?`
    Created a vpiInterModPath                 Icarus `-sdf-info`
    ^SDF INFO: ... Putting delay              Icarus `-sdf-info`, one per delay
    ^SDF ERROR: ... Unable to match ModPath   Icarus `-sdf-info`, one per arc
    ^\\s*\\[TB <id>\\] PASS                      the case's own marker

None of it has a negation form.  The `-sdf-info` channel emits ONE LINE PER
EVENT; there is no line saying a delay was NOT applied, and absence is already
how these readers answer.

THIS FILE IS THE MEASUREMENT BEHIND THAT CLAIM, and it is a measurement rather
than a restatement because it CORRECTED the claim: 84 of 399 trials really do
move a published answer.  Every one of them is a prefix — the markers are
anchored under `re.M` and text in front of one displaces it off the line start —
and every one moves the SAME WAY, toward reporting LESS.  Not one of the 399
makes a reader report a fact the transcript does not carry, which is the
question the gate asks.
