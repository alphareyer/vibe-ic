"""v1.4.21 regression — the at-speed ATPG producers (DT1 transition-delay /
DT2 path-delay) must resolve a std-cell Liberty chip/PDK-AGNOSTICALLY.

Defect (spm clean-run): both producers globbed ONLY `input/pdk/liberty/*typ*.lib`
and, when that project-relative tree was absent (the mainstream sky130 flow whose
Liberty is container-baked and recorded per-project in pvt_matrix.json, NOT
shipped in-tree), fell through to a NON-EXISTENT `input/pdk/liberty/typ.lib`. So
gate-levelise read a missing file → producer verdict=ERROR → DT1/DT2 FAIL — a
false FAIL that never measured coverage. The shared `_resolve_design_liberty`
adds the flow-recorded-corner + shared-OSS-default fallbacks.

    it salvages the partial log — but it means the wall clock DECIDES a verdict,

    vibe-ic#2100.  What stood here was
    `_img.local_image() or _img.IMAGE_REPO + ":latest"`, and the `or` arm is
    the whole defect: the skip guard probed a reference the run does NOT use.
    `fault_atpg_run` starts `_eda_image.resolve()`, which is the pinned
    `<configured repo>@<digest>`; the guard asked about
    `ghcr.io/vibeic/vibeic-eda:latest`, a floating tag naming whatever this
    machine last pulled under that name.

    MEASURED 2026-09-07 on 8HD-4 with `VIBEIC_EDA_IMAGE_REPO` UNSET: the pinned
    reference was not present (the fleet holds those bytes under a different
    repository), `local_image()` answered None, the `:latest` fallback WAS
    present as an unrelated 0.3.x image, so the guard declared the image
    available and the test ran — and `fault cut` came back
    `exit 125: Unable to find image '<pinned ref>' locally … manifest unknown`.
    A guard that answers about a different image than the run is worse than no
    guard: it converts "this verification did not happen" into a red that
    blames the producer.

    There is deliberately NO fallback.  A host that does not hold the pinned
