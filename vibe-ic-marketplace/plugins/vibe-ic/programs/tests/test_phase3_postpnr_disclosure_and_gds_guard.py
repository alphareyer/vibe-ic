"""ORGANIC #593 stale-GDS guard — EXECUTABLE, end-to-end through `main()`.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
====================
The only pre-existing coverage of the #593 guard was
``test_v0_3_41_issue593_pnr_cache_geometry.py::
test_orchestrator_cache_skip_is_geometry_aware``, which asserts
``"_pnr_reran" in inspect.getsource(R.main)``. A PERMANENTLY-FALSE variable
satisfies that assertion, and that is exactly what happened: the pad-side
capture appended a disclosure ``StepResult`` right after PnR, so
``plan[-1].name == "pnr"`` was never true again, ``_pnr_reran`` was
dead-False on every path, and a geometry-changing re-dispatch re-ran PnR,
produced a NEW DEF and then SHIPPED THE PREVIOUS DIE'S GDS — with DRC/LVS
signing off on it — under the benign-looking row
``"GDS already present: top.gds (skipped re-run)"``.

The whole failure is invisible to a source-string test, so these tests DRIVE
``main()`` and observe whether ``step_gds`` was actually called. The same
latent bug also fires WITHOUT this capture whenever
``step_signoff_spef_repair`` or the DRV escalation appends a row, so the
guard is now taken from the PnR row BY NAME rather than from ``plan[-1]``.

Scenario under test is the one #593 was filed for: unconverged at
1233x1233 -> operator re-dispatches ``--die-um 1500x1500 --util 0.3``.
