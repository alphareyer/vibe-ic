"""test_issue2150_split_expectation_grammar.py

One expectation can now ask N layers, and agrees only when EVERY branch does
(vibe-ic#2150, class 3).

WHAT WAS MEASURED, ON PRISTINE MAIN
-----------------------------------
An expectation carries ONE `layer`. When the program track extracted a fact
whose halves live in two different layers, no expectation could say so: asked
of either layer it is `met: False`, and `owning_layers` is empty because no
SINGLE layer carries every token, so the row falls through to `about: "design"`
— "the program track is missing this" — about a fact the program track has, in
full, twice over.

MEASURED on the surviving opentitan_aes Phase-1 root, one fact, two spellings:

    UNSPLIT  L1.fields ["one-hot", "SoC integration spec"]
             met=False  missing=['SoC integration spec']  owning_layers=[]
             -> about="design"  EXPERT_TRACK_AI_EXPECTATION_UNMET
    SPLIT    [L1.fields ["one-hot"], L19.fields.notes ["SoC integration spec"]]
             met=True   -> no design finding at all

A conjunction that cannot be written down is not a fact the corpus lacks; it is
a sentence the grammar cannot say, and the report blamed the design for the
difference. #2127 recorded exactly this as an open follow-up: "2 need a SPLIT
the grammar lacks (one expectation cannot ask two layers)".

THE SPLIT IS A CONJUNCTION, NOT A DISJUNCTION
---------------------------------------------
Every branch must agree. An "any branch" form would make a two-branch
expectation EASIER to satisfy than either of its halves — a comparator that
gets weaker as an author writes more, which is the opposite of what this track
is for. The test that pins this is paired: one branch missing is enough to make
the whole split disagree.

WHAT ELSE IS PINNED
-------------------
  * EVERY ill-formed split is a refusal to DECIDE (`usable: False`, reported
    under RULE_AI_UNUSABLE), never a verdict. Silently treating a broken split
    as "not met" would put a design finding on the record for an authoring
    mistake, which is the family of defect this whole issue is;
  * each branch is SCOPED on its own — the #2127 reading, per branch;
  * the field_path guard fires PER BRANCH, named `<parent id>#<i>`, so an
    author repairs the one branch rather than re-reading all of them, and it
    stays ADDITIVE: it never moves the verdict;
  * MEMBERSHIP: a split produces exactly ONE verdict finding, never one per
    branch — a row that decided once must be counted once;
  * a SINGLE expectation is decided exactly as before this landing.

Every fixture is synthesised here from neutral parts. No design, PDK, vendor or
IP-model identifier appears anywhere in this file.
