    This receipt used to read NOT_APPLICABLE — the HARDMACRO answer, "nobody's
    slot, so no budget" — which a die inherited once `slot_rules_are_owed`
    learned to say the same of a die that bought nothing. A die is not exempt
    from a pad budget: it IS its own operator (37.5self), and its budget is the
    ring the run builds against the pins it declares. The landed contract in
    `test_issue2277_slot_pad_budget_reads_the_designs_own_route.py::
    test_a_DIE_against_the_same_catalogue_still_gets_a_real_verdict` states it
    and was red on main until that branch existed.

    What this fixture still pins is the ROUTE: the die purchased nothing, so
    the receipt names the die's own basis and not an operator slot. This tree
    stages no RTL, so the measurement itself is UNDECIDED with its reason —
    rc 2 exactly as before, and never a pass.
