"""#172 (A12) — the runner's OWN emitted synth command must pass the runner's
OWN yosys hilomap audit.

The step-14 auditor (`yosys_hilomap_required_check`) FAILs a real-PDK synth
script that carries no `hilomap`. The EMITTER
(`_v1_6_596_build_hilomap_directive`) only emits `hilomap` when the PDK's tie
cells are DISCOVERABLE. On ASAP7 the tie cells are `TIEHIx1_ASAP7_75t_R` /
`TIELOx1_ASAP7_75t_R`, which the pre-#168 `$`-anchored tie-name patterns did
NOT match — so the emitter returned "" (no hilomap) and the runner's own synth
command was flagged non-conformant by its own auditor. #168 (A8) broadened the
tie-name patterns; these tests pin the end-to-end alignment: for an ASAP7-style
PDK the emitter now produces a hilomap directive, and a synth script carrying
that emitted directive PASSES `yosys_hilomap_required_check` — while a synth
script that genuinely OMITS hilomap still FAILs (the gate is not weakened).

CUT_W4: the auditor half (a script carrying the directive passes / one without
it fails) moved to the netlist gate, test_cut9_step14_judges_the_handoff_netlist
(a netlist synthesised without hilomap FAILs on its constants). The emitter
half stays: the direct recipe still runs outside the chip path.

chip-AGNOSTIC: a synthetic ASAP7-style liberty with the real TIE token +
drive-strength + library suffix shape; no chip / SKU literal.
