"""tests/test_docker_exec_timeout_bytes.py — v0.2.36

Regression for the str/bytes crash that killed a long phase3 PnR run.

Root cause: on `subprocess.TimeoutExpired`, the partial captured
`stdout`/`stderr` can come back as BYTES even though `text=True` was
requested (the streams are killed mid-decode). The old `_docker_exec`
returned that bytes value verbatim, which then poisoned every
downstream `out + err` string concat — notably
`step_pnr` → `_extract_overutil_pct(out + err)` →
`TypeError: can't concat str to bytes`. That TypeError crashed the
runner AFTER OpenROAD had already launched a multi-hour route, so the
process died with no `routed.def`.

Fix: `_docker_exec` now decodes any bytes partial → str so all callers
always receive `str`. Chip-AGNOSTIC pure I/O-type hygiene."""

    THE STUB ANSWERS THE ARGV IT IS ASKED, AND NEVER THE HOST (vibe-ic#2106,
    then vibe-ic#2145). `_docker_exec` does not reach `subprocess.run` first:
    `_exec_argv` decides a ROUTE and then builds the argv through
    `_container_exec.docker_exec_argv`, which asks `_eda_pin` whether the
    container is running the pinned bytes — a `docker inspect` of its own. Two
    different callers, and each has to be answered with something its real
    caller could actually receive:

      * `docker exec …` — THE SUBJECT. Bytes on a `text=True` call, which is
        exactly the condition this test exists for and the one CPython really
        produces when a stream is killed mid-decode.
      * `docker inspect …` — the pin probe. `rc=1` with STR streams is docker's
        own "no such container", which `container_pin_state` classifies
        UNREADABLE. Deliberately not a MISMATCH: `docker_exec_argv` RAISES on a
        measured mismatch, so a stub that faked a wrong image would replace this
        test's subject with the refusal path and never decode anything.
      * anything else — REFUSED, loudly. There is no third caller on this path,
        and an `else` that quietly answers one is how this test stopped being
        about the decoder at all.

    THE ROUTE IS PINNED, BECAUSE IT WAS THE HOST THAT WAS BEING MEASURED.
    #2106's version of this stub keyed on `"exec" in argv` with a silent `else`,
    and `_exec_argv` asks `_local_exec_mode()` -> `no_container_route()` ->
    `shutil.which("docker") is None` BEFORE it builds anything. On a host with a
    docker client the argv is `docker exec …` and the test passed; with no
    docker client on PATH the route is LOCAL, the argv is `["bash","-lc",…]`,
    it carries no `exec` element, and the silent `else` handed THE SUBJECT
    docker's rc=1 "no such container". MEASURED 2026-09-07 on 8hd-3, both
    directions, one tree per commit:

                    | host (docker on PATH) | pinned image (no docker client)
        ebb00b1b4^  | FAIL (#2106)          | PASS
        ebb00b1b4   | PASS                  | FAIL   <- vibe-ic#2145

    So `_LOCAL_EXEC_MODE` is set explicitly here. That is not narrowing the
    population: the container route is this test's SUBJECT — a route with no
    `docker exec` in it cannot be the one whose result is being decoded — and
    the other route is covered by its own arm below, so both are asserted
    instead of one being decided by whatever host the suite lands on.
