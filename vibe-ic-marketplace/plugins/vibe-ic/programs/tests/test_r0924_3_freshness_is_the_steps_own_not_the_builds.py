"""R-0924-3 — a cached step is fresh when THE STEP has not changed.

THE MEASURED DEFECT (spm run23, lane icspm5, 2026-09-23):

    [synth] the cached synth artefact was produced by a DIFFERENT build
    (plugin 1.23.70 -> 1.23.93; recipe e8fb29723876 -> cf8b2cd4ba76)
    — re-running

`--force-step gds` on a FINISHED tree re-ran synthesis and started PnR, because
freshness was decided from `_plugin_version()` + `_recipe_sha256()` — the
released version and the sha256 of the WHOLE ~66k-line runner. Both are facts
about the BUILD. Every landed fix bumps the version, so every landed fix
invalidated every cached step, whatever it actually touched.

The same key was simultaneously TOO NARROW, which the old code disclosed in a
comment instead of fixing: an in-tree edit to a helper module with no version
bump was not detected at all.

This deck holds BOTH halves, because a fix for either one alone is a different
and worse bug:

  SYMPTOM 1 (too coarse)  a no-op version bump must REUSE.
  SYMPTOM 2 (too narrow)  a helper edit with no version bump must INVALIDATE.

and it holds the fail-closed rules, which are the reason this is safe at all:
an unknown component is never freshness.
