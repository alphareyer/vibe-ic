"""#2230 — a container guard that asks RUNNING and never asks WHICH IMAGE.

THE DEFECT, MEASURED
====================
`vibeic-eda` is a bare, shared, guessable container name. Six test modules
carried their own copy of

    docker inspect -f {{.State.Running}} vibeic-eda   ->  "true"  ->  guard OK

and a seventh (`test_v0_2_97_issue472_473_476_phase2.py`) handed that name to
the runner with no container guard at all. Running is not usable: the answer is
`True` for whatever process reached the name first.

MEASURED 2026-09-10, 8HD-8, clean main `9c653d47f`, against a container named
`vibeic-eda` started 2026-09-05 on `sha256:06537f7e…` while the pin is
`sha256:89a8fd72…`:

    7 files RED, 10 test ids, ONE cause — and none of them about the tree.

The attach check one layer down (`_eda_pin`, #2076) refuses correctly; the
guard had already committed the test to a red instead of the skip an ABSENT
container has always got.

WHAT THESE TESTS PIN, AND WHY THEY CANNOT PASS BY ACCIDENT
==========================================================
Every fact here is arranged, never observed: docker is faked present, the
container is faked RUNNING, and the digest is faked — matching in one direction
and mismatching in the other. So the verdict is a property of the guard, not of
whichever container happens to hold the name on the machine running the suite.
That is the whole point of the issue, and a test that read the host would
inherit the defect it is pinning.

The mismatch direction is the one that fails on the unfixed tree: presence-only
guards answer True there. The MATCH direction is asserted too — a guard that
refused everything would satisfy the first half and disable seven files.

chip-AGNOSTIC: container identity only.
