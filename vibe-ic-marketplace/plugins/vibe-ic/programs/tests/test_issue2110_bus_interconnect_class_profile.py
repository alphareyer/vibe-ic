"""Regression for #2110 — the class profile for `bus_interconnect_protocol`.

THE CORPUS ARM FOR THIS CLASS IS EMPTY, AND THAT IS SAID FIRST. The shipped
classifier puts three corpus doc-sets in this class and NOT ONE of them carries
a design input the retrieval can read — they have no `input/` tree at all. So
unlike the classes profiled beside it, this profile has no "here is what the
pack used to be on a real design of the class" measurement behind it, and no
amount of test structure creates one. The evidence it does have is stated
below, and the ruling that authorises a profile on that evidence is the one
that says a class with no corpus design may be profiled only where its FEATURES
ALONE determine the selection.

THEY DO, HERE. `ic_class_profile._BUS_PROTO_FEATURES` is an explicit six-entry
structural table, every one of whose features has craft in the DB, and the map
is pinned in both directions. Two properties stand in for the corpus arm, and
neither is a restatement of the map:

  * CONFINEMENT — a brief written from the class's own vocabulary retrieves a
    pack that is five-for-five OUT of class unconfined (a shift collector, a
    register slave, a multiplier, a register file with BIST, a ping-pong
    buffer) and five-for-five IN class confined, with the two arms disjoint.
  * REACHABILITY — every entry the profile selects actually surfaces in a
    top-5 pack for at least one brief written from a feature's own vocabulary.
    An entry that no realistic brief can rank into the pack is dead weight the
    membership assertion cannot see, and one candidate (`skid-buffer`) was
    dropped from this profile BECAUSE it failed this check: it is genuine
    interconnect craft, it answers none of the six features, and it never
    reached a top-5. Both reasons are recorded; either alone would have been
    enough.

chip-AGNOSTIC: every fixture is synthetic.
