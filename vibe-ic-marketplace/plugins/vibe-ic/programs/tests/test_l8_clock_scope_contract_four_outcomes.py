"""The PDK-scoped L8 clock contract — all four outcomes, both consumers, both
directions.

RULING R-0915-6 (2026-09-15) composed two independently measured halves into
ONE contract, and required that BOTH consumers of a scoped L8 clock apply it
identically:

  1. a scoped record matching the run's PDK by NAME or FAMILY  -> selected
  2. none scoped matches, but an UNSCOPED design-owned record exists
                                                               -> selected,
     and the summary says ``unscoped_design_owned``
  3. only foreign-scoped records                               -> refuse
     (``L8_CLOCK_SCOPE_MISMATCH`` — the honest case)
  4. scoped records and no run PDK known                       -> NOT_MEASURED

The halves, and where each was measured:

  * lane icaes, on AES: a design that states an unscoped clock alongside a
    scoped one was refused outright. Outcome 2 is that half.
  * lane icspm, on SPM (this file's author): the consumers took the target
    from ``L19.fields.pdk_target`` — the FIRST family L1 names — rather than
    from the PDK the run actually targets, and compared it with ``==`` across
    two naming registers. Outcomes 1 and 4 are that half. Measured end to end::

        $ vibe_ic_one_shot_runner.py <project> --pdk gf180mcuD --ic-name spm
        FAIL sdc_gen rc=1 L8_CLOCK_SCOPE_MISMATCH: no scoped L8 clock matches
                                                   L19 target 'sky130'
        overall verdict : FAIL     halted at : phase2

WHY THE TWO CONSUMERS ARE TESTED TOGETHER IN ONE FILE: they must SELECT THE
SAME RECORD. When ``sdc_gen`` and ``l8_clock_period_actionability_check``
disagreed, the generator emitted an SDC the checker then failed — on inputs
that were entirely self-consistent. A per-consumer test file cannot see that
class of defect; ``test_both_consumers_agree_on_every_outcome`` can.

EVERY fixture is synthesized neutral data, in the sibling file's idiom:
``fixture_core``, ports ``clk_a``. The process names are the two spellings of
one open family and one spelling of another, because the register difference
between a PDK name and a family name IS the thing under test and cannot be
expressed with invented strings the family registry does not know.
