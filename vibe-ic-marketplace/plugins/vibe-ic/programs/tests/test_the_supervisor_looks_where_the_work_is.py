"""A child told to work INSIDE a container must be supervised inside it.

MEASURED on spm x gf180mcuD, run8 (2026-09-21, image 0.3.67): the `gds` step's
own extras carry

    die_finishing: false
    die_finishing_note: "die finishing did NOT complete: STALLED: no forward
    progress across 12 consecutive looks (15.00s apart, 195.2s elapsed);
    signals readable: cpu,io,output; cmd: ... die_finishing_gen.py ..."

and the work that call was doing had ALREADY produced
`phase3/stage3/pnr/spm.sealed.gds` (95,414,116 B) and
`reports/phase3/sealring_verify.json` — `pdk_seal_ring_present`, top cell
chip_top, ring 0..3162 um outer / 16..3146 um inner, 201,182 um2 added, core
clearance MEASURED with 0 encroaching polygons, `verdict: PASS`. Only
`reports/phase3/die_finishing.json` was never written: the process was reaped
between the verify and the write. `die_finishing_check` then exited rc=2
("die_finishing_gen has not run"), `tapeout_precheck` booked
UNDETERMINED/General.SealRing, and a die that HAS a verified seal ring carried
that as one of five sign-off FAILs.

The supervisor was not wrong about what it could see. `_progress_run`'s own
header states this shape (vibe-ic#2083) and ships the remedy: the host-side
python client's CPU, I/O and output all sit flat while KLayout computes inside
the container, so a caller that knows where its work lives injects a probe that
looks THERE. Three call sites in the runner hand their child
`VIBEIC_EDA_CONTAINER=<container>` and then watched only the client.

Both directions are tested: a quiet child whose CONTAINER work advances is not
reaped, and a child that has genuinely stopped everywhere still is.
