"""Regression for #2110 — the class profile for `serial_peripheral_protocol`.

THE DEFECT, MEASURED ON THE CLASS'S OWN CORPUS. #2094 named every registered
ic_class in the expert DB, twelve of them `null` — a DECLARED gap, so those
classes kept the unconfined phrase ranking. `serial_peripheral_protocol` is the
class the corpus supports best after the two already profiled: the shipped
classifier puts 22 corpus doc-sets in it, 11 of which carry a design INPUT the
retrieval can read. On pristine main, 10 of those 11 packs were led by an entry
from another design family — `serial-parallel-multiplier` on nine of them (the
same literal-phrase collision #2094 was opened for: a serial peripheral's own
prose says "serial", and the entry that owns that word is about a multiplier),
plus `axi-stream`, `axi-stream-width-downsizer`, `axi-mmio-cdc-datapath`,
`apb-csr-shift-register`, `priority-interrupt-controller`,
`line-buffer-window-extract` and `sipo-multiblock-crc-ecc-datapath`.

THE SELECTION IS DERIVED, NOT CHOSEN. Every db_class in the profile answers at
least one of the six structural features
`ic_class_profile._SERIAL_PROTO_FEATURES` uses to ASSIGN this class, and every
one of those six features has craft in the profile. `test_every_selected_db_
class_answers_a_feature_the_classifier_uses` pins that map in both directions:
an entry answering no feature carries knowledge with no referent in the class,
and a feature with no entry leaves a defining part of the class uncovered — and
the second is the half nobody notices.

WHAT IS NOT IN IT, AND WHY (both stated so a later reader does not have to
re-derive them): the DB's line-coding family — `line-encoder`,
`line-code-decoder`, `serial-line-encoder-mux`, `parallel-lfsr-prbs` — is real
craft that several designs of this class genuinely need, and it answers NONE of
the six features, so the derivation excludes it. `apb-csr-shift-register`
matches the shift-register feature on its NAME and is about an APB control/status
wrapper, which is another class's craft.

chip-AGNOSTIC: every fixture below is synthetic. The one real-corpus fact used
is the SENTENCE SHAPE of the collision, which names no chip, vendor, SKU or node.
