"""FX_P2 (3c, second half) — the phase-2 final audit judges THIS run's record,
not the previous run's.

MEASURED on subservient (8HD-4, 2026-09-28, the proof command on a fresh copy
of an earlier run's tree): final_audit FAILed `project_outputs_in_tree_check`
on "2 blocking external-storage reference(s) (0 live, 2 dangling)" in
`reports/orchestrator/phase2_one_shot.json`. Both were
`/tmp/vibeic-rtl-step-*/sub` -- a stage path cut mid-token -- in the EARLIER
run's record: the runner wrote its own record only after the audit. The new
record (written 25 s after the audit) carried none, and the same gate passed on
the finished tree. The audit judged a document this run was about to replace.

Driven through the real publisher and the real gate.
chip-AGNOSTIC: synthetic project.
