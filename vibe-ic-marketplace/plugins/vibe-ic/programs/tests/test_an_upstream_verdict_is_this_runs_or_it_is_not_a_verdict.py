"""An upstream verdict is THIS RUN's, or it is not a verdict.

R-0915-152. `release_docs_check` excuses 37.5ic's missing release documents when an UPSTREAM
step's own verdict says that step is blocked. The authority is right (R-0915-149); the
RECORD it read was not, in three independent ways, and each one is measured here rather than
argued:

  1. THE NAME. `reports/metrics/{sid}.json` is not what `step_metrics.emit` writes -- it
     normalises the id first, so step `37.4`'s row is `37_4.json` under key
     `37_4__flow__step_status`, and `M1`'s is `m1.json`. Every dotted or suffixed step was
     therefore looked for where nothing writes. The old code returned ABSENT for those, ABSENT
     is not a blocking tier, and a genuinely FAILED upstream step was recorded as passing
     while 37.5ic took the blame.
  2. THE RUN. That file persists across runs, and nothing in it said which invocation
     measured it, so one failed pass excused 37.5ic forever.
  3. THE SELF-FREEZE. `_emit_step_metrics` could not refresh its own `step_status`: the
     no-clobber filter that stops the wrapper overwriting a PROGRAM's measurement also
     stopped it overwriting its OWN previous value. Pass 1 FAIL, pass 2 PASS, file still
     FAIL -- driven twice below, not reasoned about.

    R-0915-165's per-step record is written temp-then-replace for the same reason the canonical

    replace leaves `<sid>.json.<pid>.tmp`, which is the auditor's own file, carries no content a
    reader could identify it by, and -- unrecognised -- is hashed as a DESIGN INPUT, so the
    design hash moves permanently on an unchanged design.

    is the third. Any atomicity mechanism the auditor adds creates a file its own identity rule
