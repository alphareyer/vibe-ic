"""R-0915-71 — step 30 reached a conclusion and wrote it nowhere.

MEASURED on subservient x gf180mcuD (lane icsub2, r25, main c0dcb5e27) — the
run that had nothing else wrong with it. Step 27 had just gone green under
R-0915-66, every other phase-3 row was a cascade, and the whole design failed
on a silence:

    required_outputs missing: ['phase3/stage3/spice/correlation.json OR
    reports/phase3/spice_correlation.json'] (satisfied: 1/2)

The deck was built AND simulated — `correlation.spice` 6616 B and
`correlation.log` 16807 B sat beside each other — and `spice_correlation_check`
PASSED. The driver had refused, with a precise sentence, reproduced
deterministically by re-running it on that tree:

    per-stage delay not measurable: stage 2: 0 of 2 drive polarities produced
    the declared output transition with a full swing; the arc is unresolved and
    no delay is taken from it; ngspice also exited non-zero

and that sentence went into a return value nobody persisted. The runner's own
disclosure-writer did not fire either: it is guarded on "no deck exists", and a
deck DID exist. So the step's declared record was never written.

A step that reached a conclusion and wrote it nowhere is worse than one that
failed loudly — a reader cannot tell it from a step that never ran.

The fix is ONE wrapper rather than fifteen edited `return` statements: every
early refusal in the driver, and every one added later, lands in the declared
record. Both directions are pinned here, and so is the thing the fix may not do
— overwrite a record a real correlation already left.
