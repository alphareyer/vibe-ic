"""A DRC report's antenna category is decided by the DECK'S vocabulary, not by
one English word (vibe-ic#2172, third recorded item).

WHAT WAS WRONG. `eda_report_audit._check_drc` classified the antenna category
with `re.compile(r"antenna", re.I)` over the report text. A KLayout gf180
sign-off RDB never writes that word: it names its rules `ANT.8`,
`ANT.16_ii_ANT.4`, `ANT.16_iii_ANT.15_V4_MIMB`, and describes each as a ratio
to "related gate oxide area".

MEASURED on the published corpus (benchmark-data 146d6656):

    ic/spm/v1.9.96_gf180mcuD/reports/phase3/drc_signoff.rpt
        antenna rule instances   20
        literal "antenna"         0
        categories_found  ['spacing', 'width', 'via', 'enclosure']

WHAT IS NOT WRONG, AND IT IS SAID FIRST SO NOBODY CHASES IT. This changes NO
project-level verdict on the corpus as it stands, and the reason is worth
keeping: `cats_found` is a UNION over every DRC report the audit discovers, and
this root's sibling `reports/phase3/drc_router.rpt` is OpenROAD's, which DOES
say "antenna" twice. Driven three ways on that root:

    drc_report_check --mode drc                     2 files  antenna PRESENT
    drc_report_check --mode drc --signoff           2 files  antenna PRESENT
    drc_report_check --mode drc --under <signoff>   1 file   antenna ABSENT

So the Step-31 shape (`--signoff`) does not narrow the file set and is masked
too. The classification is wrong at the REPORT level and latent at the PROJECT
level; it surfaces for any caller that narrows to the sign-off report, and for
any gf180 root whose OpenROAD router report is absent or itself antenna-free.
`DRC_CATEGORY_PRESENT` is a WARNING and is documented in that function as
"informational only, never gating", so no `passed` moves either way.

OVER-MATCH CONTROL, which is the direction a widening goes wrong in. Over the
31 DRC reports of the published corpus: 14 matched before and still match,
**2 files / 1 ROOT** gained (that spm report, under two paths), 15 still do not
match. The tokens are anchored so the English words that merely contain "ant"
cannot match.
