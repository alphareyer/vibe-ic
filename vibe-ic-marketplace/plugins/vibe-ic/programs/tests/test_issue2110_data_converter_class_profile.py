"""Regression for #2110 — the class profile for `data_converter`.

THE DEFECT, MEASURED ON THE CLASS'S ONE CORPUS DESIGN. `data_converter` was
split out of `pure_analog` by #613 precisely because such a design HAS a digital
datapath — the decimation / serial-readout chain that has to reach synth, PnR
and GDS through `spec-to-rtl`. Its expert pack was still phrase-selected. On
pristine main the class's one corpus design got:

    serial-parallel-multiplier, serial-parallel-multiplier,
    sigma-delta-modulator, mac-accumulator, spi-serializer-fsm

Four of five out of class; the single in-class entry ranked third, and the
class's own READOUT craft — the decimation chain, which is the half of the
design the class exists to name — did not appear at all.

THE DERIVATION IS SHAPED BY THE CLASSIFIER, AND THIS CLASSIFIER IS A
CONJUNCTION, NOT A FEATURE TABLE. `ic_class_profile` assigns this class when
`has_analog AND NOT has_command_protocol AND NOT has_fsm AND
_v1_6_613_has_digital_serial_readout`. Only the POSITIVE conjuncts can have
craft: a negative conjunct states what the design is NOT, and there is no craft
for an absence. So the map below has two entries and two explicit empties, and
the empties are written down rather than omitted — an omitted key and a key
mapped to nothing are the same dict and very different claims.

chip-AGNOSTIC: every fixture is synthetic.
