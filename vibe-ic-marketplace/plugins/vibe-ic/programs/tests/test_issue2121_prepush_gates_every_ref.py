"""#2121 — a multi-ref push was gated by whichever ref the loop saw LAST.

`tools/git-hooks/pre-push` read git's ref lines in a `while` loop and assigned
`PUSH_RANGE` / `PUSH_BASE` / `PUSH_TO_MAIN` / `PUSH_HEAD` / `PUSH_DEST_REF` once
per ref, then ran the gate set ONCE, AFTER the loop.  So a push carrying several
refs — `git push origin a b`, `git push origin branch main`, `git push --all` —
was judged entirely by its last ref, and every other ref reached the remote
ungated.

REPRODUCED ON `94617408759e` BEFORE ANYTHING WAS CHANGED, on the real hook, with
the stdin git gives it.  A synthetic repo in the shipped layout, `next/x` whose
only difference from `main` is a swept 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1 version bump (which
`branch_version_bump_guard` refuses) and `next/y` carrying an ordinary commit::

    next/x alone                        rc 1   gate named
    next/y alone                        rc 0
    next/x THEN next/y, ONE push        rc 0   <- the offending ref slips past
    next/y THEN next/x, ONE push        rc 1   gate named

Both orders are damage and neither is the safe one:

  * a BRANCH bundled behind `main` is judged by MAIN's rules, so it is asked for
    a `gatekeeper-land.sh` stamp no contributor can mint;
  * `main` bundled behind a branch is judged by the BRANCH's rules, so the stamp
    is never demanded and the version gate is deferred to a gatekeeper who is
    not in this push.

SECOND LAYER, in the same block.  The stamp comparison read
`HEAD_SHA="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"` — the WORKING TREE's commit.  In
`git push origin next/x main` the working tree is on `next/x` while the ref
under judgement is `main` at another commit, so the stamp was compared against a
commit nobody was publishing — refusing a stamped main tip, and accepting an
unstamped one whenever HEAD happened to carry the stamp.

WHAT EACH ARM IS FOR
--------------------
  * `test_the_gates_run_inside_a_per_ref_loop`      — the wiring. RED on main.
  * `test_END_TO_END_the_offending_ref_is_refused_when_it_is_not_last` — the
    behaviour, driven through the real hook. RED on main.
  * `test_END_TO_END_the_other_order_is_refused_too` — the same two refs the
    other way round, which main already refused: without it the arm above could
    be passing because the fixture refuses everything.
  * `test_END_TO_END_a_clean_ref_alone_still_passes` — the no-over-refusal arm.
    A hook that refuses ordinary work is a hook that gets `--no-verify`'d.
  * `test_MUTANT_gating_only_the_last_record_lets_it_through` — the mutation
    arm. Take the SHIPPED hook, narrow the loop to the LAST record only (which
    is exactly the pre-fix behaviour), and the same fixture pushes clean.
  * `test_the_stamp_names_the_ref_being_pushed_not_the_checked_out_HEAD` and its
    `test_MUTANT_...` partner — the second layer, both directions.
