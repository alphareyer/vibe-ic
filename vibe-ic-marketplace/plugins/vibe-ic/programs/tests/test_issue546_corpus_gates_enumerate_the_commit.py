"""test_issue546_corpus_gates_enumerate_the_commit.py — a corpus gate's input is
what the COMMIT carries, not what this disk holds.

WHAT WENT WRONG (vibe-ic#546)
=============================
`shipped_path_portability_check` and `dead_plugin_path_check` enumerated with
`rglob`, so their input set included whatever the last local run left behind.
Measured at f7b9c7fa0, the SAME COMMIT on two trees:

    shipped_path_portability   3654 file(s) scanned   vs  3595 in a fresh worktree
    dead_plugin_path           3379 examined          vs  3323

The residue is generated test fixtures under
`programs/tests/fixtures/synthetic_benchmark_phase1/`, ignored by `.gitignore`.
That is why this was invisible for so long: `git status --untracked-files=all`
does NOT list ignored paths, so every "is the tree clean?" check said yes.

The verdicts agreed, which is the trap — a count difference is the OBSERVABLE
evidence that the input sets differ, and waiting for a verdict to flip means
waiting for the damage. A fixture written with an absolute path would have made
the portability gate FAIL on its author's machine and PASS in CI, for a file
that is in neither commit.

`_published_tree` was built for exactly this class and its docstring already
records three earlier instances (v1.6.88, v1.6.90, l4_systemrdl_export). These
two gates are the fourth and fifth; the fix is to adopt it, not to invent
anything.

WHY THESE TESTS DRIVE `main()`
==============================
They assert on the PRINTED verdict line, not on a returned structure. A
disclosure a reader never sees is not a disclosure — the #539 mutation set
proved that exact point, where stripping the disclosure from the printed line
left a test asserting on the struct still green.
