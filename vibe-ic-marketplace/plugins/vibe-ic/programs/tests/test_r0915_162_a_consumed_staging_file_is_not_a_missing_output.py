"""R-0915-162 — a staging file consumed by an in-place promotion is not a
missing output, and the exemption is decided by the BYTES.

MEASURED on spm run23 (plugin ec313cde7 / v1.23.70). The P0 umbrella failed on
its only failing sub-gate:

    [FAIL] project_outputs_in_tree_check: 1 blocking external-storage
    reference(s) (0 live, 0 dangling, 1 outside-root)
      - reports/phase3/die_finishing.json
          → /foss/designs/run23/phase3/stage3/pnr/spm.sealed.gds (NOT on disk)

while the SAME record said `seal_ring.state: PASS`, `generator_rc: 0`,
`ring_check.verdict: PASS`, and `spm.gds` sat in the tree at 102,923,002 bytes
where the prefinish stream had been 73,850,996. `die_finishing_gen` promotes a
verified ring with `staged.replace(dest)`, so the staging path is gone BY
DESIGN and its bytes live under the final name.

The fix is NOT to loosen the checker: every other missing or external reference
keeps its finding. The producer states the consumption in a VERIFIABLE form and
the checker checks it against the bytes.
