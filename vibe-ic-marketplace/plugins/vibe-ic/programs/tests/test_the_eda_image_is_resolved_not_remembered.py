"""The plugin ASKS the image which image it is; it does not remember a version.

WHAT THIS REPLACES, AND WHY IT WAS REPLACED TWICE
=================================================
Round one: the image version was a literal in eleven places, kept in step by
`tools/vibeic-eda/sync_image_version.py --check` and advanced by a PR that
vibeic-eda's daily release opened on this repo, on the stated grounds that the
pinned tag "matches what the plugin was VERIFIED AGAINST". Measured 2026-08-20:
nothing verified that. The literals went; a single ANCHOR FILE stayed, because a
gate that reports FAIL about the image's CONTENTS must not have its verdict moved
by a third party's push (vibe-ic#927).

Round two — this file. `tools/vibeic-eda/VERSION` was still vibeic-eda's version
number stored in the vibe-ic repo, so a vibeic-eda release still needed a PR here.
Measured 2026-08-21 on 8HD-9:

  * the anchor said `0.3.16`; the newest vibeic-eda image on the host was
    `0.3.13`. `docker run …:0.3.16` printed "Unable to find image locally" and
    began a multi-gigabyte pull — inside a hygiene gate. The anchor was not
    protecting a verdict, it was preventing one;
  * `sync_image_version.py --check` was RED on main, and the "live pointer" it
    wanted rewritten was a comment recording which image a yosys measurement had
    been taken on. The coupling was demanding that a record be falsified;
  * of 11 registered install docs, one still carried an X.Y.Z pin. The docs had
    already decoupled themselves.

THE MECHANISM NOW — two facts, both asked of the image, neither stored here:

    DIGEST   `repo@sha256:…`, immutable; what a recorded verdict is replayed with
    VERSION  the image's own `org.opencontainers.image.version` OCI label; what a
             human reads

The label is BELIEVED VERBATIM. Published images today still inherit upstream
iic-osic-tools' `2026.06`; from vibeic-eda 0.3.19 the label is the fork's own
version, and no code here changes when that happens. A shape check to tell the
two apart would be a workaround for one release window and dead code for ever
after, so there is none, and `test_the_version_label_is_believed_verbatim` pins
that there is none.

Properties this file holds, each with a way of quietly coming undone:
  1. NOTHING in the shipped tree reads a vibeic-eda version out of OUR source —
     the rule that stops round two coming back (section 1);
  2. `resolve()` never answers a bare `:latest` — `docker run …:latest` does not
     consult the registry, so it means "whatever this machine pulled, whenever";
  3. `resolve()` and `local_image()` stay DIFFERENT questions — collapsing them
     hands `docker run` a multi-gigabyte fetch where a skip guard expected a
     local check;
  4. RUNNING a tool and JUDGING one stay different questions, and the judging one
     makes no registry call it was not asked to make (vibe-ic#927's property,
     which survives the anchor it was first written against);
  5. a verdict-bearing report cannot be written without both facts, and a gate
     that cannot establish them exits its own NOT-MEASURED code rather than
     reporting about silicon (section 5).

    WHY A MODEL AND NOT TWO STUBS — vibe-ic#2130. The test below stubbed
    `local_tags` alone, which WAS the whole of `judged_image`'s local rung when
    it was written. The resolver then grew "THE PIN, RESOLVED BY DIGEST" AHEAD
    of it, and that rung asks docker through `_eda_pin`, not through
    `local_tags`. So on every fleet host that has pulled the pinned digest —
    the NORMAL state of all five — the resolver answered with the pinned
    reference while this test asserted `None`. The test was red and the program
    was right: it was asserting about the HOST, not about the resolver.

    A hand-listed set of rungs goes stale exactly the way that one did, so the
    model is installed at the two things a rung can ASK — what this host holds,
    and what the registry says — and every other route to the daemon is a
    REFUSAL that names the argv it saw. A rung added tomorrow either goes
    through one of these leaves and is told the host holds nothing, or it trips
    the refusal and this file says so by name. What it cannot do is quietly
    answer from the machine the suite happens to be running on.

    The registry leaves FAIL rather than returning nothing, because reaching
    the registry without `allow_pull` is the other half of what this test is
    for: a gate that starts a multi-gigabyte fetch is a gate people switch off.

    Returns the list of leaf names the resolver actually reached, so the caller
