"""The auditor has ONE writer, and this test is what keeps it that way.

R-0915-168. Three reviews found the same defect in three places: a temp or a lock the auditor
creates is the AUDITOR'S file, carries no content a reader can identify it by, and
`design_input_digest` therefore hashed the leftover as a DESIGN INPUT -- so an interrupted pass
moved the design hash permanently on an unchanged design.

    R-0915-151  the canonical audit's temp   `<audit>.json.<pid>.tmp`
    R-0915-152  the note's lock and temp     `audit_created/<hex>.json.lock`, `....<pid>.<tid>.tmp`
    R-0915-165  the per-step record's temp   `step_outputs/<sid>.json.<pid>.tmp`

Each was patched with its own shape, after its own review. This file is the general form: the
shape is declared once in `_path_layout`, minted only by `_auditor_write`, recognised by the
digest through that declaration -- and the guard below goes RED on any file-creating call in the
auditor's own modules that bypasses the helper. A fourth mechanism is covered the day it is
written rather than the day someone notices.
