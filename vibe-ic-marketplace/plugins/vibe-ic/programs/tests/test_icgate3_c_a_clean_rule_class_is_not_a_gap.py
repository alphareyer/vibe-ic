"""R-icgate3 — "category not found" must be a fact about the REPORT, never a
claim that the rule class went unchecked.

MEASURED on spm run15 (8HD-4, `_lane_icspm5/run15`). Step 31's sign-off audit
(`reports/phase3/drc_signoff.json`) opened with

    DRC_CATEGORY_PRESENT  WARNING
    DRC category 'density' not found in reports

which reads as "density was not checked". It was:

  * `reports/phase3/drc_signoff.log` line 12 --
        Selected decks: ... cup, density, df_10, ...
  * the same log, lines 481-486 --
        Executing rule PL.8 / M1.4 / M2.4 / M3.4 / M4.4 / M5.4
  * the report (`drc_signoff.rpt`, a KLayout report-database) carries
    ZERO items for any of those six, so all six PASSED.

WHY THE REPORT CANNOT SAY SO. The open PDK's density deck emits its category
INSIDE the branch that detects the violation
(`rule_decks/density.rb`: `if (metal1.area / chip_area) * 100 < 30 then
extent.output('M1.4', ...)`), so a clean density rule leaves no trace at all.
MEASURED on the same report: 764 rule classes declared, 762 of them carrying
zero items -- the format DOES declare clean rules -- while 11 of the 774 rules
the log says executed declared no class, the six density rules among them.

The old sentence was therefore satisfiable ONLY by a die that FAILS density: it
reported the good outcome as a gap, and it was the FIRST thing a reader saw on
a row whose real defect was `DRC_REAL_VIOLATIONS_FOUND: 5`.

WHAT DID NOT CHANGE, and it is the point: this probe has never gated `passed`
(the audit's own comment says so), and the fix touches no count, no verdict and
no exit code. Re-running `drc_report_check . --mode drc --signoff --under
reports/phase3/drc_signoff.rpt` over run15's bytes before and after gives
rc=1 / passed=False / 5 findings / categories_found
['spacing','width','antenna','via','enclosure'] / real_violation_total=5 on
BOTH sides. Only the sentence differs.

chip-AGNOSTIC: no IC, vendor, SKU or process is reasoned about.
