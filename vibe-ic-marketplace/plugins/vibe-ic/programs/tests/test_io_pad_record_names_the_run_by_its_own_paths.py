"""The IO-pad chip-top record names the run's own files by their run-relative
path, never by the mount the producer happened to run under.

MEASURED (subservient x gf180mcuD, IC route, 8hd-3, 2026-09-28, run root
`subic_ic_20260928`): step 15.5ic's producer runs INSIDE the EDA container,
where the project is bind-mounted at `/foss/designs/<run>`, and it wrote

    "project": "/foss/designs/subic_ic_20260928"
    "netlist": "/foss/designs/subic_ic_20260928/phase2/stage2/synth/subservient_synth.v"

into `reports/phase3/io_pad_chip_top.json`. Read back on the host, the first
names a directory that does not exist there, and P0's
`project_outputs_in_tree_check` FAILed the run on it:

    1 blocking external-storage reference(s) (0 live, 0 dangling, 1 outside-root)
    reports/phase3/io_pad_chip_top.json -> /foss/designs/subic_ic_20260928

The gate was right about the record: a spelling that resolves only under one
mount is not a reference a reader can follow. The producer now records every
path inside the run root relative to the run root (and the run by its
directory name), so the same record reads the same under every mount. The gate
is NOT changed; the controls below prove it still blocks on both a genuinely
external reference and the exact spelling the run recorded.

HOW THE CONTAINER IS SIMULATED. Without root a test cannot bind-mount, so it
reproduces the one property a bind mount has that matters here: the tree is
spelled one way when the producer WRITES the record and another way when the
gate READS it. The producer runs on `<tmp>/ctr/foss/designs/<run>`; that same
tree is then renamed to `<tmp>/host/<run>` and the gate reads it there, where
the write-time spelling no longer exists.

WHY THE PDK ROOT IS PASSED RELATIVE. The fixture PDK lives under pytest's
tmp_path, which is `/tmp/...` on most hosts, and every `/tmp` path in a
declaration file is blocking for this gate by design. A real run's PDK is
`/foss/pdks/...`, outside that population. Passing the fixture PDK as a
relative root (from the fixture's own directory) keeps the harness's location
out of the verdict, so the gate's answer turns on the project-path spelling
alone -- the one thing under test.
