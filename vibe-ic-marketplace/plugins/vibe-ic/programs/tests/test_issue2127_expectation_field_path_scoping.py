"""test_issue2127_expectation_field_path_scoping.py

An expectation's SCOPE is checked, and a fact one layer over is not a missing
extraction (vibe-ic#2127).

WHAT WAS MEASURED
-----------------
`converge_ai_expectation` read the expectation's `layer` and PRINTED its
`field_path`. On a published Phase-1 run all 46 consumed expectations named a
`field_path` under a top-level key the addressed layer does not declare at any
depth, so every finding read

    expected <layer>.<fabricated path> to carry: <requirement>.
    The program track produced: <layer> does not carry [...]

— an authoritative sentence about a field nothing had looked at, because the
whole layer was searched and the path was decoration. Downstream, 11 of the 43
disagreements on that run named facts another layer carried IN FULL, and were
published as `about: "design"`: the tree was reported as missing facts it
demonstrably had, which points a reader at an extractor for a defect that lives
in the expectation.

Two checks close it, and they are deliberately INDEPENDENT:

  * the field_path GUARD refuses an undeclared path BY NAME and does NOT touch
    the verdict — so a moved verdict can never be blamed on the guard;
  * MISSCOPE detection reclassifies a miss the addressed layer does not explain
    but another layer does, `about: "track"`, naming the owning layer.

AND WHERE THE TOKENS ARE LOOKED FOR (#2127 addendum, from #2128)
----------------------------------------------------------------
The token test was whole-token but UNSCOPED: it searched the layer's entire
serialized content, so any field could satisfy any token, and a phrase could be
ASSEMBLED out of parts belonging to different fields. MEASURED on a real run, a
new unrelated L19 key `yielded: false` made the token "false" score and moved a
row from 2-missing to 1-missing on a coincidence. MEASURED here on neutral
fixtures, three more assemblies the layer never states:

    {"x": ["power", "domain"]}   phrase "power domain"  -> matched
    {"mode": "fast"}             phrase "mode fast"     -> matched
    {"busy": {}, "mode": {}}     phrase "busy mode"     -> matched

So the reading is SCOPED to the field the expectation names when that path
resolves, and matched WITHIN ONE UNIT (one key, or one scalar) rather than over
a joined document. When the path does not resolve there is nowhere to scope to;
the whole-layer reading is kept — moving 46 of 46 verdicts is a much larger
decision than this one — and the scope is RECORDED so a `met` obtained without
scoping is visibly the weaker claim it is.

NOTE, so nobody reads more into it: the matcher was never a SUBSTRING test.
`REF` did not match inside `REFHI` before this landing and does not now. What
it did was match across field boundaries, which has the same effect and a
different cause.

Every test here is PAIRED, in the manner of the sibling #312 file: the refusal
case is matched by an acceptance case, and the misscope case by a genuinely
absent fact, so a check that always fired would fail as loudly as one that
never fired.

Every fixture is synthesised here from neutral parts. No design, PDK, vendor or
IP-model identifier appears anywhere in this file.
