"""A redirected receipt is where the gate's verdict IS. Read it there.

THE REGRESSION THIS CLOSES, measured. v1.23.23 made a clause's `--json` receipt
go to a scratch path whenever the named target was a document the run had
already produced, so that the audit stops overwriting the run's own evidence
(R-0915-126: producer writes, gate reads). But the verdict READER kept reading
the path the clause NAMES -- which now holds the PRODUCER's document, and a
producer's document carries no gate verdict. On the spm S arm that turned
step 14 (Synthesis handoff gate) from PASS into NOT_MEASURED, moved seven more
steps from FAIL to NOT_MEASURED, and on the subservient replays turned step 7's
NOT_APPLICABLE into NOT_MEASURED.

`NOT_MEASURED` over a gate that ran, exited and wrote a verdict is the worst of
the three answers: it is indistinguishable from a gate that was never wired.

Both directions are pinned here. The receipt is followed when it was
redirected; the clause's own path is still read when it was not; the producer's
document is never read for a verdict and never written; and a receipt that
disagrees with the document proves WHICH of the two was consulted.
