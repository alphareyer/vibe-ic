"""Tests for phase1_one_shot_runner.py — Phase 1 (Path A) orchestrator.

Wave 83 — coverage for previously untested orchestrator.

Phase 1 wraps tools/phase1_engine/cli.py. Tests run the orchestrator's
control-flow only — they verify the runner SKIPs cleanly when no input
is staged, FAILs cleanly when phase1_engine is unreachable, and emits
the aggregate JSON report under reports/.

Cases:
  1. EMPTY_FIXTURE_IS_BLOCKED — project dir present but no input files →
                           canonical step D1's `required_inputs` pre-flight
                           REFUSES: the ingest step is never dispatched, the row
                           is BLOCKED / REQUIRED_INPUT_ABSENT, the verdict is
                           FAIL and the exit code is 1. (Until the pre-flight
                           was wired this SKIPped with exit 0 and verdict
                           PASS_WITH_WAIVERS — a pass tier over a Phase 1 that
                           was handed nothing to read.) Its REVERSE half —
                           the same project plus ONE staged prompt — completes.
  2. POSITIVE_FAIL_MISSING_PROJECT — non-existent project dir → exit 2.
  3. INTEGRATION_REPORT_SHAPE — emitted phase1_one_shot.json must contain
                                  phase / project / steps / verdict keys.
  4. STEP_DETAIL_REASON_PRESENT — when SKIPped, the detail explains
                                    that input/phase1_structured.yaml or
                                    input/docs/ is missing.
  5. INPUT_DOCS_TRIGGERS_INGEST — staging input/docs/ flips the runner
                                    out of SKIP into ingest_render.
                                    Without phase1_engine cli installed
                                    the step records FAIL but the runner
                                    still emits a summary report.

#: `_run`'s default, and now the ONLY bound in this file. NOT a round number
#: picked by feel: `ci_harness_timeout_ceiling_check` (BLOCKING) resolves the
#: pytest harness bound from `tools/gatekeeper-land.sh` — `--timeout=180`,
#: `--timeout-method=thread` — and permits any ONE blocking call at most
#: `180 // 3` = 60 s. Above that the inner bound can never fire: pytest reaches
#: 180 s first and takes the whole SESSION down, so `--maxfail` stops counting
#: and every other file in the subset loses its verdict, including files that
#: had already passed.
#: The default was already 60 and correct. Two call sites OVERRODE it with 300,
#: which is the shape a per-call bound invites: the safe default is declared
#: once and then walked past one keyword at a time. MEASURED here: the runner
#: over a tmp_path project with one staged prompt takes 2.23 s worst of six
#: calls, so neither override was buying anything — 60 s is ~27x measured.
#: The two sites still PASS it explicitly rather than falling through to the
#: default. Dropping the keyword altogether also silences the finding, but it
#: does so by making the bound unreadable: the gate resolves a module-level
#: int and a literal, never a parameter forwarded from a signature default, so
#: those two call sites would have left its denominator (`bounded_sites`)
#: instead of satisfying it. A green earned by becoming invisible to the check
#: is the failure this gate family exists to prevent, so the count is held:
#: 745 readable bounds before this change, 745 after.
