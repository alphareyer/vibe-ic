"""The pin: the seal-ring generator contract, read from upstream.

`die_finishing_gen` drives the PDK's own seal-ring generator through what its
header calls upstream's interface "unchanged": four flags, and a named skip on
the same unset PDK-scoped variable. That is a contract with code this module
does not own, and it was written down once.
