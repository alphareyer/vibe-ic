"""vibe-ic#2169 — an import is not an invocation, and ONE resolver decides it.

Two instruments audit the same question in this tree. `gate_is_wired_check`
asks whether any automatic verdict invokes a gate; `checker_execution_wiring_
audit` asks whether anything but a checker's own unit test runs it. Their
POPULATIONS had to be reconciled once already (vibe-ic#1130). #2169 is the same
divergence one level in, on the RULE:

    gate_is_wired      refused a DEAD import since `invocation.v1`, and since
                       vibe-ic#2141 credits only what reaches the gate's
                       VERDICT.
    _py_evidence       added the name to `invoked` on the IMPORT STATEMENT
                       ALONE — `checker_execution_wiring_audit.py:519` as
                       shipped through v1.19.32.

The fix is not a third copy of the rule: it is `_invocation_credit`, the one
definition site both call. So this file asks two kinds of question — does the
RULE decide correctly, and do BOTH INSTRUMENTS get their answer from it.

EVERY DENIAL HERE IS TWO-DIRECTIONAL. A rule that only ever refuses is
indistinguishable from a broken parser, so each denial is paired with the same
fixture put through `_invocation_credit.RULES[PRIOR_RULE_ID]` — the superseded
credit-on-import rule — which must CREDIT it. If a control ever stops
crediting, the fixture has stopped reaching the code and the denial beside it
proves nothing.
