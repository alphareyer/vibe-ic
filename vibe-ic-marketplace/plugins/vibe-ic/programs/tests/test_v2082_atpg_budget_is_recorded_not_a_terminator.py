"""vibe-ic#2082 — the stuck-at ATPG's wall budget stopped the engine.

`step11_dft_insertion` reported

    SKIP  "Fault ATPG exceeded its 1800s wall budget -> disclosed-skip
           (budget, not capability)"

on a design (sha256, lane rbsha2, 2026-09-07) whose AT-SPEED ATPG ran 52
minutes on the same tree and PASSED. A clock decided that a progressing job's
product does not exist -- and the step then recorded the absence as a
capability gap, which is a machine-readable claim about the ENGINE.

v1.17.70 removed the RUNNER's outer wall around this producer (CZT-10/CZT-11).
The producer's OWN wall was left: `run_fault` launched `fault atpg` through
`_run_docker(..., timeout=_atpg_wall)`, which puts coreutils `timeout` inside
the container as the engine's parent and signals it at the number. That is the
correct way to enforce a deadline and the wrong thing to be doing at all, and
it is the site this file pins.

THE RULING (cztimeout / czstarve / vibe-ic#2051): a progressing job is never
cut off. The ceiling RECORDS the crossing, announces it once, and the job
continues; only a job with NO forward progress is stopped, by the watchdog that
reads its progress. So the declared budget is not raised and not deleted --
what it DOES changes.

MEASURED, both directions, on a real `fault atpg` (spm cut netlist, -v 2000,
~37 s) in the pinned image on 8HD-9. Same engine, same argv, same container in
both arms; the only variable is what the declared number does:

    declared budget 10 s, PRE-FIX (the wall)   rc 124 at 10.5 s, NO product
    declared budget 10 s, this fix (recorded)  rc   0 at 37.7 s, product
                                               written, crossing recorded

and, stopped rather than slow (`docker pause` on the container this call
minted, stall grace 60 s):

    stopped        rc 199 (RC_STALLED) at 75.4 s, reaped, container gone,
                   "WATCHDOG_STALLED ... watched=output+cpu
                    since_last_progress_s=60.112"
    not stopped    rc 0 at 39.7 s, product written, not reaped
