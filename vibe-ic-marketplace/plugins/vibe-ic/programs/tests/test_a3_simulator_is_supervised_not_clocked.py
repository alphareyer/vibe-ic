"""A3's simulator launch is SUPERVISED, and its budget is a record that is
actually said out loud (vibe-ic#2117).

WHAT WAS WRONG, IN TWO PARTS.

1. THE LAUNCH WALKED AWAY FROM A LIVE SIMULATOR. `verify_with_ngspice` entered
   the container through `container_deadline_argv(..., deadline_s=0)` and
   `_progress_run.run`. No clock fired — `deadline_s=0` is GNU `timeout`'s
   documented "disable the associated timeout" — but on a stall `_pr.run`
   RAISED and the function RETURNED `SIMULATION_STALLED`, leaving the still
   ngspice running inside the container. That is precisely the orphan
   `_container_exec` exists to prevent, now with a verdict written about it.
   The site was recorded in `watchdog_container_deadline_baseline.json` as
   CONTAINER_DEADLINE 4 rather than converted, because converting a live
   ngspice launch wanted its own proof. This file is that proof.

   MEASURED 2026-09-07 on 8HD-9, image sha256:8c5694ab (0.3.48), a real
   ngspice on the real `ldo` deck, SIGSTOPped inside the container:

       pre-fix  : SIMULATION_STALLED, ngspice pid 162 state T, STILL ALIVE
       post-fix : SIMULATION_STALLED, reap evidence `VIBEIC_REAP TERM 162`,
                  ZERO ngspice left in the container

2. THE BUDGET WAS ANNOUNCED TO NOBODY. `run_in_container_supervised` documented
   `ceiling_s` as "recorded and announced once"; `_watchdog` does call an
   INJECTED `ceiling_notice` — and `_progress_run.run`, the entry point that
   path reaches the supervisor through, passed none and does not carry the
   supervisor's `observations` back on the `CompletedProcess`. So every
   `ceiling_s` ever handed to that function was a declared control nothing
   could observe. MEASURED, same host, same image, the real `ldo` deck through
   `verify_with_ngspice`:

       ceiling_s=2      elapsed 10.5 s  CONVERGED, 1 measurement,
                        1 x VIBEIC_CEILING_CROSSED at elapsed_s=2
       ceiling_s=10000  elapsed 10.7 s  CONVERGED, 1 measurement, 0 announcements

   The second row is the control: the announcement is caused by the CROSSING,
   not by the code path existing.

Nothing here needs a docker client: the announcement is proven end to end
against a REAL local subprocess, and the container-shaped assertions inject
the supervisor rather than stubbing the answer.

#

# to `run_in_container_supervised` is only worth anything if the stall reap
# actually reaps, and MEASURED on 8HD-9 in the pinned image it did not:
#
#     E2, pre-fix : SIGSTOP ngspice mid-run -> SIMULATION_STALLED,
#                   `VIBEIC_REAP TERM 43 62`, `VIBEIC_REAP_SKIP already_gone`,
#                   ngspice 62 STILL ALIVE in state T
#
# Two independent causes, and either alone is enough to leave the orphan:
#
#   * A STOPPED PROCESS CANNOT ACT ON A TERM. The signal is queued and the
#     grace elapses against a process that was never able to answer.
#   * THE KILL PASS IS GATED ON THE ROOT. `supervised_container_command` execs
#     `bash -lc <cmd>`, so the stamped pid is that SHELL for any command that
#     is not a single simple command -- which is the normal case, and it is the
#     process that DOES obey the TERM. The escalation then reads the stamp,
#     finds the root gone, prints `already_gone` and signals nothing.
