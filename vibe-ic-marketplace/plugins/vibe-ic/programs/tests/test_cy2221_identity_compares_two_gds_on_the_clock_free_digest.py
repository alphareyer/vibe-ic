"""test_cy2221_a_gds_carries_its_own_clock.py — #2221, both directions.

THE DEFECT, MEASURED BEFORE IT WAS REPAIRED (2026-09-10, 8HD-6, image
`ghcr.io/vibeic/vibeic-eda:0.3.41`, corpus `8c4b608`): one layout
(`ic/spm/v1.10.18_sky130A/.../spm.gds`) was read ONCE into KLayout and streamed
out TWICE, two seconds apart.

    sizes            1616344 vs 1616344    identical
    raw md5          bf1b51eb…  vs  0cae1964…
    differing bytes  98 of 1616344
      inside a BGNLIB/BGNSTR date payload    98
      outside                                 0

49 date records (1 BGNLIB + 48 BGNSTR). So byte-equality over a GDS reports
"the stream-out is not reproducible" on every design, forever, and says nothing
about the geometry.

WHAT IS PINNED HERE, and what deliberately is NOT. The raw hash stays exact
everywhere it attests a single artefact -- that is asserted below, because a
"fix" that quietly canonicalised the attestation would have destroyed the one
property those gates exist for. Only the COMPARISON of two runs moves.
