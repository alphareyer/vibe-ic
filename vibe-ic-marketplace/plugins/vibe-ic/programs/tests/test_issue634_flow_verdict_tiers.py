"""vibe-ic#634's anti-drift property, carried forward onto `programs/verdict.py`.

WHAT #634 WAS. `flow_compliance_check` PRODUCED per-step verdict words and
`flow_step_execution_coverage_check` CONSUMED them, and each kept its own list
of which words meant "done". The lists drifted: a step wearing `STRUCTURE-ONLY`
was counted as done by the producer's arithmetic and was invisible to the
ordering guard, so a tree that DISCLOSED its content came from a library default
scored where one that said nothing passed. `_flow_verdict_tiers` fixed it by
DERIVING done-ness — "a word is a done-claim iff it is neither EXCUSED nor
NON-GREEN" — so a tier invented tomorrow was adjudicated without anyone
remembering to register it.

WHY THAT MODULE IS GONE, AND THIS FILE IS NOT. Derivation-by-subtraction was the
right answer to a vocabulary that could grow. R-0915-85 made it a vocabulary
that cannot: five words at the producers, `verdict.parse` refusing a sixth, and
a tree-wide ratchet (`step_verdict_vocabulary_ratchet`) that fails at the commit
which introduces one. So the derivation goes with the module it lived in — but
#634's PROPERTY does not, and it is pinned here against the replacement.

THE ONE ANSWER THAT MOVES, stated because it is a real behaviour change and not
a rename: `INCOMPLETE`, `NOT-MEASURED`, `VACUOUS-PASS` and `STRUCTURE-ONLY` sat
in NEITHER negative set, so by subtraction they were DONE-CLAIMS — a step that
had measured nothing was adjudicated as claiming to be done. Two of them are
`NOT_MEASURED` now and answer False. That is #634's own incentive argument
reaching its conclusion.
