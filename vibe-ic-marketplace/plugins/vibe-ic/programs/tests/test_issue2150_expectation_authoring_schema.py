"""test_issue2150_expectation_authoring_schema.py

The hand-off pack carries the declaration an expectation author needs, derived
from the project's own Phase-1 root — and it is the SAME declaration the
review-time guard reads (vibe-ic#2150 F5).

WHAT WAS MEASURED, ON PRISTINE MAIN
-----------------------------------
`ic_expert_backup_pack.assemble` wrote a HARD-CODED two-entry layer contract

    {"L9": "integration specification",
     "L19": "constraints and implementation context"}

for a project whose Phase-1 root carries 24 layer documents, and an
`answer_contract` documenting `field_path` as `"optional field path"` and
nothing else. An author handed that pack can address only two of the
twenty-four layers, and can only INVENT a path out of the two prose
descriptions it was given. That is where `integration.*` on L9 and
`constraints.*` on L19 came from — and the #2127 guard then refused 46 of 46
field_paths as undeclared. The pack manufactured the authoring defect, and the
guard reported the author for it.

A guard that refuses at review time and a schema that refuses at authoring time
are the SAME declaration read at two moments. Measured on the surviving
opentitan_aes root after this landing: the contract names 24 layers instead of
2, and carries 504 declared field paths instead of none, dated with the root's
own digest.

THE AGREEMENT IS THE POINT, AND IT IS PROVEN BOTH WAYS
------------------------------------------------------
`declared_field_paths` is a candidate GENERATOR whose output is filtered by
`subtree_at` — the one resolver `field_path_status` uses. It is deliberately
not a second authority: an earlier revision of #2127 had exactly that, a
second walk collecting "the paths this document declares", and the two answers
disagreed within a day.

That sweep also caught a bug in this landing's own author-side resolver. Two
layer documents share a numeric prefix (`L8_RTL_CONSTANTS` and
`L8_TIMING_WAVEFORM`); a single-pass match that accepted either an exact name
or the `L<number>` token returned whichever sorted first and answered about the
wrong document. 502 of 504 paths agreed and both disagreements were that
collision. It now matches exactly as `resolve_layer_file` does — exact first,
token second — and the sweep is 504 of 504.

Every fixture is synthesised here from neutral parts. No design, PDK, vendor or
IP-model identifier appears anywhere in this file.
