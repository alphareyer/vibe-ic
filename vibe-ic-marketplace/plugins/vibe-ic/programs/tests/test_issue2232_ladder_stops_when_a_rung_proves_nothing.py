"""A rung that proves NOTHING NEW ends the ladder — it does not start another.

THE MEASURED FACT THIS SUITE IS BUILT ON (vibe-ic#2232, `ic/sha256`, 8HD-9).
The rung that did the work took **700.6 s** and left `1611 proven / 2 unproven`.
The ladder then started the NEXT rung anyway, which printed

    Proved 0 previously unproven $equiv cells.
      Of those cells 1611 are proven and 2 are unproven.

and the ladder started a THIRD rung on top of that — `attempt 4`,
`current_pass equiv_induct_seq64`, `elapsed 8.21 h`, `rss 10.1 GiB`, every
attempt carrying `budget_sec 86400`. 700 s of proof followed by 7.5 h that
moved nothing, with 24 h per attempt authorised to keep moving nothing.

The driver already MEASURES the thing that decides this: every leg records
`proved_at_entry` (its own read-back `equiv_status`) and `proved_at_exit` (its
closing one), because #2194 needed the proof state's survival across the
process boundary to be measured rather than assumed. Nothing compared the two
in the direction "did this rung earn the next one".

WHAT THESE TESTS PIN, each one a direction the change could go wrong in:

  * a rung that proves nothing NEW, with a residual still standing, ENDS the
    ladder — the rung above it is never launched, and the record says which
    rung stopped it and why;
  * A LADDER THAT IS STILL PROVING IS NEVER TRUNCATED. The control: every rung
    proves something, and all four still run. A guard that stopped a
    progressing ladder would buy the wall clock back by throwing proofs away;
  * A FINISHED PROOF IS NOT A FLAT WALL. When the residual is ZERO the deeper
    rungs necessarily print `Proved 0` too — that is a proof, not a wall, and
    it must still reach PASS over the whole ladder;
  * the stop is HONEST about which resource ran out: the closing
    `equiv_status` is the LADDER's, the residual is NAMED, and the report must
    not claim a budget was spent when none was.
