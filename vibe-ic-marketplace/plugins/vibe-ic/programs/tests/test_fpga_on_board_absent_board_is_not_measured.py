"""Step 39 with no board on the bench reads NOT_MEASURED, never PASS or FAIL.

Owner ruling (fleet ledger 2026-09-25 15:2x): steps 6 and 39 (FPGA on-board)
are excluded from the IC "truly PASS" goal and are reported separately as
NOT_MEASURED, never called PASS. review70 step 39 (migration 39): no LibreLane
or OpenROAD step compiles or programs an FPGA, the image has no Quartus, so the
attestation gate stays a vibe-ic gate and reports NOT_MEASURED "until a board
and Quartus host exist".

`fpga_on_board_attestation_check` reported `overall: FAIL` for a project that
never had a board test. It now reports NOT_MEASURED with the same rc 1 when
none of the physical evidence classes exists, and still FAILs a manifest that
claims a pass with nothing physical behind it.
