"""Regression for #2110 — the class profile for `digital_cmd_driven`.

THIS CLASS WAS REFERRED UP, NOT SKIPPED, AND THE REFERRAL IS ANSWERED BY
MEASUREMENT. `test_issue2110_unprofiled_classes_are_decisions` records the six
other still-null classes as DECISIONS with measured reasons and this one as the
single open question, on two grounds. Both were re-measured on pristine main
before this landing and neither survives:

  (1) "no readable corpus design; seven classified doc-sets, zero with an input
      the retrieval can read". Measured over every `*/phase1/generated_docs`
      tree reachable on the measuring host (2974 doc-sets, 346 of them
      classified into this class): SIX distinct design inputs of this class are
      readable — `input_text_report(...)['status'] == 'READ'` — and the class's
      own protocol corpus alone holds fifteen designs. The premise is a fact
      about the corpus a lane could reach, not about the class.
  (2) "the features-alone condition is a judgement because the assigning
      condition is a conjunction one of whose conjuncts is a disjunction".
      The disjunct is `has_analog`, and it is CRAFT-INERT: the DB carries no
      entry for the analog half (already pinned, twice, in the decisions file),
      so the two assigning routes select the SAME entries. That is checked here
      by construction rather than asserted — see
      `test_the_two_assigning_routes_select_the_same_entries`. A condition whose
      two branches cannot disagree is a reading, not a judgement.

THE DEFECT, MEASURED ON THE CLASS'S OWN CORPUS (pristine main e2b3c08170b5).
On all SIX readable designs the unconfined top-5 was LED by an entry from
another design family — an AXI-stream image-frame processor on three of them, a
serial-parallel multiplier on two, a clock divider on one — and 28 of the 30
slots were out of class. Not one of the three dispatcher entries this profile
selects (`command-driven-memory-controller-fsm`, `fsm-controller`,
`fsm-register-interface`) reached any of the six packs: the craft for the one
thing the class is named for, executing a host-issued command, was unreachable
on every design of it. The two in-class slots that DID land were
`mmio-register-controlled-counter`, on two designs.

THE DERIVATION HAS A THIRD SHAPE, AND IT IS THE CLASSIFIER'S. The classes
profiled before this one are decided by a FEATURE TABLE (`_SERIAL_PROTO_
FEATURES`, `_BUS_PROTO_FEATURES`, …) or by a CONJUNCTION of profile flags. This
one is decided by a DISJUNCTION OF TWO CONJUNCTIONS, and it has exactly ONE
positive discriminator, `has_command_protocol`. One feature cannot by itself
justify four entries, so the selection is derived from what the shipped tree
says a design carrying that feature must DOCUMENT: `_CLASS_LAYER_REQUIREMENTS
['digital_cmd_driven']` makes L3, L4 and L6 mandatory, and
`_CONDITIONAL_LAYER_GUARDS` says L3 and L6 are mandatory BECAUSE of
`has_command_protocol` / `has_fsm`. Those three layers — the command set, the
register state it changes, the control logic that runs it — are the parts, and
`_PART_TO_DB_CLASSES` maps them to craft in both directions.

WHAT IS NOT IN IT, AND WHY (recorded so a later reader does not re-derive them):
`apb-master-fsm` is a two-phase bus initiator and the DB's own `related` names
three `bus_peripheral` entries — bus craft, not command-dispatch craft.
`priority-interrupt-controller` is the interrupt-controller family and its
`related` names `processor-cpu-core`. `mmio-timer-counter` is write-one-to-clear
status and undecoded-address read behaviour, which is verbatim the
`bus_peripheral` integration contract. `onehot-control-decode` matches the
decode part on its NAME and its one lesson is an area-optimisation rewrite; the
DB has an area-optimization family that owns it. `nvm-fuse-array` is the OTP
conjunct's ONLY entry and taking it would empty `mixed_signal_otp`'s half.

chip-AGNOSTIC: every fixture below is synthetic. The corpus facts quoted above
are counts and SENTENCE SHAPES; they name no chip, vendor, SKU or process node.
