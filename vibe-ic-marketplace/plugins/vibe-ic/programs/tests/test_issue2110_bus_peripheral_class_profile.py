"""Regression for #2110 — the class profile for `bus_peripheral`.

THE DEFECT, MEASURED ON THE CLASS'S OWN CORPUS. `bus_peripheral` was one of the
twelve classes #2094 left `null`. The shipped classifier puts three corpus
doc-sets in it; two carry a design INPUT the retrieval can read, and on pristine
main BOTH got a pack that was five-for-five out of class:

    a memory-mapped user project   mmio-register-controlled-counter,
                                   priority-interrupt-controller x3,
                                   cdc-mux-synchronizer
    a bus-interface doc-set        axi-stream-width-downsizer, axi-stream,
                                   axi-mmio-cdc-datapath, integer-clock-divider,
                                   cdc-mux-synchronizer

Ten of ten out of class, and the DB carries six entries of genuine
bus-peripheral craft — the register map with its CSR band, the subordinate
channel FSMs, the bus-phase response discipline, the reserved-bit and
read-only-write semantics, and what a named bus interface implies when the input
is silent. None of the six reached either design.

DERIVED, NOT CHOSEN. Every db_class answers at least one of the five structural
features `ic_class_profile._BUS_PERIPHERAL_FEATURES` uses to ASSIGN this class,
and every one of those features has craft in the profile; the map is pinned in
both directions.

THE LINE THIS PROFILE DRAWS, and it is pinned so it stays a decision: the class
is the BUS INTERFACE, not the function behind it. `mmio-register-controlled-
counter`, `mmio-timer-counter` and `apb-register-peripheral-pwm` are craft about
a counter, a timer and a PWM — a bus peripheral is not necessarily any of those,
and a pack that hands a register-bank design a counter's off-by-one lesson has
imported a function it does not have. `apb-master-fsm` is the INITIATOR's craft
while the class's own feature is `bus_subordinate`. `bus-protocol-bridge` is an
interconnect element. `fsm-register-interface` is named for this class and its
five lessons are dominated by priority-interrupt-controller lifecycle craft.

chip-AGNOSTIC: every fixture is synthetic; the one real-corpus fact used is the
SHAPE of the collision, which names no chip, vendor, SKU or node.
