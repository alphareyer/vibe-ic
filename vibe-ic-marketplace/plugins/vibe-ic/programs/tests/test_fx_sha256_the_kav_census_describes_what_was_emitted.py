"""The known-answer-vector census describes what the ladder EMITTED.

MEASURED (sha256 x sky130A, front door): `l10_unit_tb_gen` reported

    known-answer vectors: 0 bound, 3 unbound -- the vectors exist and could
    NOT be driven, e.g. fips1804_sha256_abc: ... register-bus route: this
    driver drives a (plaintext -> ciphertext) block vector ...

while all three FIPS known-answer TBs had been written, by the next rung of
the same ladder (`_emit_case_stated_vector_bus`), and passed. The known-answer
rung records its refusal before the ladder moves on; the census read that
intermediate refusal as the case's final state.

Drives the real ladder (`testbench_gen.emit_unit_tbs`) over the stated-vector
fixture the landed R-0915-113(2) deck transcribes, then the runner's own
census over the producer's report.
