"""vibe-ic#2122 — a DIE owes its own seal ring a band, and nothing may be
sealed into it.

WHERE THE BAR COMES FROM. Not this repo's opinion: three runs of the SAME PDK
generator and the SAME sign-off deck on one gf180mcuD die (vibeic-eda#189,
re-measured in vibe-ic#2122):

    the ring alone, on an empty 503 um die                    16, all density
    that ring around the run's own core, which filled         1,359,531
      (0,0;503,503) — GR.4 1,299,340 · GR.2 24,652 · PL.6 7,205 · …
    the same core moved 28.5 um inward, 560 um die                     0

19,826 core shapes sat inside the 16 um ring band. The generator, the ring and
the deck were all correct. The DIE was too small by the ring's band plus the
deck's own marker clearance — `sealring_edge_width = 16` in the generator's own
cell library, and GR.2's `comp.separation(guard_ring_mk, 10.um)` in the deck —
and the flow sized the die to the core and then sealed the ring on in place,
reporting `seal_ring.state = PASS`.

Every test below breaks something that fix defends and requires the failure:

  * the margin is INVENTED rather than read           -> the parsers here read
                                                         the PDK's own words
  * the technology says nothing                       -> NOT_MEASURED by name,
                                                         and the floorplan is
                                                         byte-for-byte today's
  * a core in the band is sealed anyway               -> die_finishing REFUSES,
                                                         naming the clearance
  * the refusal cannot fail                           -> the same fixture one
                                                         micron the other side
                                                         of the boundary seals
  * a pinned die is grown out from under its operator -> only the core moves
