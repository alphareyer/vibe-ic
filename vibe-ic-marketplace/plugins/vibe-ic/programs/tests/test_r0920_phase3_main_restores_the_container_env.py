"""`phase3_one_shot_runner.main()` gives the environment back.

WHY. The runner publishes the operator's `--container` choice into
`EDA_CONTAINER`, because several PDK-resolution helpers read it from there
rather than from the argument threaded through the steps. Inside the run that
is correct, and it is correct for every subprocess the run spawns. But this
program is also IMPORTED and its `main()` called in-process -- by the MCP layer
and by tests -- and `--container` DEFAULTS to a name, so one in-process run used
to leave every later PDK read in the same interpreter pointed at a container.

MEASURED on a8c7a3e74: `_pdk_layer_authority._environment_query` routes a PDK
read into a container whenever `EDA_CONTAINER` is set, so
`test_the_technology_answers_the_precheck_not_the_declaration` -- whose fixture
builds its technology under a `$PDK_ROOT` that exists only on the HOST -- was
41 passed alone and 9 failed / 32 passed after `test_phase3_delivery_admission`
(which calls `R.main()` in-process) ran before it in the same session. The gate
said "the technology's own layer table could not be read", which was true of the
container and false of the tree under test.

Both directions are pinned here: the variable is restored whatever it was, AND
the leak's actual consequence is reproduced from the environment variable alone,
so a future reader can see what the restoration is buying rather than take it on
trust.
