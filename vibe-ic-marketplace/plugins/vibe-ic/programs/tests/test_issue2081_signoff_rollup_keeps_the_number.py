"""test_issue2081_signoff_rollup_keeps_the_number.py

A one-shot runner's per-step rollup must not silently amputate the reason a
FAILING step computed (vibe-ic#2081).

WHAT WAS MEASURED, AND WHERE
----------------------------
#2081 was filed from the published sha256 run (lane rbsha6). Its first stated
defect is that the design "halts at `drv_promotion_corroboration` — which
reports FAIL with no detail at all (the two gates behind it carry the
numbers)". Reproduced against that run's own artefacts on 2026-09-10:

  * the gate's report,
    `reports/phase3/sta/drv_promotion_corroboration.json`, carries
    `signoff_drv_violations: 368`, `claimed_drv_after: 176` and the sentence
    that explains them. It is not detail-free;
  * `run2.log:152` — the rollup a reader actually sees — is 157 characters and
    ends `"... but the sign-off report the acceptance gate"`, mid-clause;
  * `368` sits at offset 133 of that detail. The renderer was
    `print(f"  {s.status:6} {s.name:8} {s.detail[:120]}")`, so the ONE number
    the gate exists to corroborate was 13 characters past the cut.

Reconstructed byte-for-byte from the shipped format string and the shipped
detail: 157 characters, identical to the published line. The cut is the whole
of the reported symptom.

The same silent cut was in FOUR runners — phase3, design (phase2), phase1 and
analog — so this is ONE root cause with four sites, not four defects.

WHAT THIS FILE PINS
-------------------
  * a NON_GREEN row keeps its reason IN FULL, so the number survives;
  * the classification is `verdict.NON_GREEN`, not a literal set
    of words re-spelled in a renderer;
  * the ANTI-CHEAT: a passing row is still BOUNDED — this landing is not "print
    everything", which would be a different change wearing this issue's number;
  * a bounded row that was cut SAYS SO and says by how much, so a rollup line
    can never again be read as a complete reason;
  * every row is ONE physical line — measured on the same log, the `em_signoff`
    row's detail is a JSON fragment and the rollup printed four lines of raw
    JSON for one step;
  * all four call sites are wired, by reading the shipped source.

No design, PDK, vendor or IP-model identifier appears in this file; the sha256
strings below are the published FINDING TEXT quoted as the subject of the
measurement, not a design input.
