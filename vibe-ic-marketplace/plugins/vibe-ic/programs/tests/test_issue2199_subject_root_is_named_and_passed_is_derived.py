"""vibe-ic#2199 — a gate that was not told what to measure must SAY SO, and a
published record must never disagree with the process's own exit code.

TWO DEFECTS, ONE SHAPE: OUTPUT THAT LOOKS ENTIRELY NORMAL
=========================================================
A gate that REFUSES is found the same day, because somebody is blocked. These
two did the opposite, which is how they survived in a tier that runs daily.

A. THREE GATES MEASURED THE INSTRUMENT.  `tools/ci/repo_hygiene_gates.sh`
   passed no subject root to `checker_execution_wiring_audit`,
   `gate_is_wired_check` or `hdl_declaration_scan_strips_comments_check`, and
   all three defaulted to a tree derived from their own `__file__`. Where the
   subject and the runtime are the same directory that is invisible. Where they
   differ — the fresh-worktree hygiene shape of #2008, an A/B base arm, every
   subject `gate_mutation_fixtures.invoke` builds — each one measured the
   instrument's tree and published the answer as a verdict about the subject.

   MEASURED on 8HD-4 at a61a8e4b4778 (tree 1de1e0882fec), two full clones, the
   subject carrying ONE extra program that is unwired and scans an HDL
   declaration over unstripped text, cwd = the subject in every arm:

       gate_is_wired_check      no --root : unwired 37 (baseline 37)   [PASS] rc 0
                                --root S  : unwired 38 (baseline 37)   [FAIL] rc 1
       hdl_declaration_scan     no --root : 159 sites, 2 new offenders       rc 1
                                --root S  : 160 sites, 3 new offenders       rc 1
       checker_execution_wiring no --root : the marker absent from the finding set
                                --root S  : the marker named in it

   `gate_is_wired_check` printed the runtime's path in its own "wiring sources"
   disclosure line while doing it. The evidence was on the screen and read as
   normal, which is the whole argument for a REFUSAL over a default: "I was not
   told what to measure" cannot be mistaken for a clean tree.

B. A HARD-CODED PASS.  `checker_execution_wiring_audit.audit()` returned
   `"passed": True` as a LITERAL and `main` dumped that record BEFORE computing
   the verdict. MEASURED on the same base tree with no synthetic input at all:
   rc 1, `[FAIL] 1 checker(s) that NOTHING but their own test runs`, and
   `"passed": true` in the JSON beside it. A consumer reading the record rather
   than the rc saw a pass.

WHAT THIS FILE PINS, AND IN BOTH DIRECTIONS
===========================================
Every arm below is written so that RESTORING the defect turns it red, not so
that today's tree happens to satisfy it:

  * the refusal arms drive each gate with NO subject and demand rc 2 — putting
    back `else Path(__file__)...` makes each of them go green-and-answer, which
    is the failure;
  * the structural arms refuse the `__file__` expression in the subject
    resolution itself, so a default that is restored WITH a refusal message
    still fails;
  * the redirect arms prove the argument reaches the subject resolution by
    naming a subject the gate cannot read and demanding that PATH in the
    refusal — a gate that quietly audits its own tree would answer instead;
  * the record arm drives four distinct outcomes (rc 0, rc 1 and two different
    rc 2s) through one `--json` path and demands `passed == (rc == 0)` every
    time, INCLUDING the rewrite of a stale PASS record by a later refusal;
  * the literal arm is structural: no `"passed"` key in the module may be
    assigned a constant, so re-introducing the literal is red whatever the
    surrounding control flow does.

chip-AGNOSTIC: gate plumbing only. No design, PDK, vendor or host literal.
