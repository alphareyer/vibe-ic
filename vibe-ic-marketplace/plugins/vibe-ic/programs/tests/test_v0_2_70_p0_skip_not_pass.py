"""v0.2.70 — #447: P0 structural-gate umbrella must not count
0-executed-checkers as PASS.

The audited rot: a pure-analog project (no RTL anywhere) showed
"[PASS] Step P0: Structural-RTL gates (226 checkers)" with the note
"SKIP: no RTL directory found" — 0/226 checkers executed yet counted
as an executed PASS in the strict verdict.

Pinned behaviour: `_run_structural_rtl_gates` returns None (not True)
as its first element when no RTL exists, and the P0 StepResult renders
SKIPPED-CONDITION (excluded from executed-PASS counts).

chip-AGNOSTIC: synthetic empty/RTL fixtures only.

    ASSERTED ON BEHAVIOUR FIRST. This used to be a source-substring test over
    `main()` (`'"NOT_APPLICABLE" if s_passed is None'`), keyed on the
    ENCLOSING FUNCTION rather than a byte window because #559's comment block
    had already pushed #447 1538 bytes away and the byte window read that as a
    regression. The verdict expression has since moved into
    `_p0_umbrella_status`, its one owner, so the substring is now checked in the
    function that owns the decision — and, more to the point, the tri-state is
    checked by CALLING it, which no relocation can satisfy accidentally.

    The `main()` half is kept as a wiring assertion: the owner is only the owner
