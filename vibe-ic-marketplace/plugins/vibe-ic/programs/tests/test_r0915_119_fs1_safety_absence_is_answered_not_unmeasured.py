"""FS1 — a design with no safety mechanism has been ANSWERED, not unmeasured.

THE MEASURED DEFECT (lane icgate1, 2026-09-21), reproduced byte-for-byte from
`spm x gf180mcuD` run13's own `phase2/stage1/rtl/spm.v`:

    "id": "FS1", "status": "NOT_MEASURED", "reason_class": "no_population",
    "disclosures": ["vacuity"],
    "reasons": ["vacuous: gate program signalled VACUOUS_PASS (input not
                 applicable), and it is 2 of 2 gate clause(s) that ran here:
                 fmeda_fault_injection_coverage …",
                "vacuous: … fmeda_coverage_check …"]

FS1's condition is `files_exist: ["phase2/stage1/rtl"]`, so the step is
APPLICABLE for every design that has RTL — which is every design — and with no
safety mechanism both of its gate clauses disclosed VACUOUS_PASS. All clauses
vacuous ⇒ `NOT_MEASURED(no_population)`, and the completion audit counts that
row against the run, on EVERY digital die, regardless of layout.

"Examined nothing" was a false account of it. `detect_safety_mechanism` READ
the design's RTL, enumerated its modules and ANSWERED the question. That is
R-0915-119's shape exactly — "a design with no arbiter has been ANSWERED about
arbiters" — so the two gates now state `NOT_APPLICABLE_BY_STRUCTURE` and carry
the enumeration that establishes it.

WHY NOT `DESIGN_DECLARED_NA`: that class requires a TYPED DESIGN DECLARATION to
have been examined (`_flow_reason_taxonomy._declared_basis`), and no L-doc in
`l_doc_taxonomy` carries a functional-safety declaration. The absence here is
derived from the checker's OWN enumeration, which is precisely the distinction
the two classes exist to keep.

AND THE READER'S HALF OF GUARD (i), which had to be repaired for any of it to
arrive. `flow_compliance_check._check_program_exit_zero` read a report's typed
class and passed it to `infer_nonverdict_reason` WITHOUT the enumeration, so
`_guard_structural` never saw a valid record and fell back to the fail-closed
default. The class was UNREACHABLE through the report channel. MEASURED on the
shipped `break_handler_safety_check`, one RTL file, rc 2 both times, the same
valid enumeration in the report, the ONLY variable being `--json`:

    no --json    -> PASS,         NOT_APPLICABLE_BY_STRUCTURE
    with --json  -> NOT_MEASURED, partial_population, and the row read "the
                    gate reports its input was applicable and was NOT
                    examined" over a gate that had examined 1 file and said so.

BOTH DIRECTIONS ARE PINNED HERE. Every negative control below keeps the rc-0
disclosed-vacuous answer it has today: an input nobody read establishes
nothing, a mechanism that was FOUND is a zero denominator and not an absence,
and a report carrying the class token with no enumeration is not believed.
