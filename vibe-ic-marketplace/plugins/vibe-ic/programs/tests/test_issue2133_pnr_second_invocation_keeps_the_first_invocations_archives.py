"""vibe-ic#2133 — a second `step_pnr` into one out_dir must not destroy the
first invocation's approach archives.

vibe-ic#2108 closed the loss WITHIN one invocation: each approach's
`openroad.log` is archived beside the canonical log before the next `| tee`
truncates it. The archive index is `_retry_i`, which is local to ONE
`step_pnr` call and RESTARTS AT 0 on the next one — and `step_pnr` is called
more than once into the SAME out_dir: `main` re-dispatches it after the PDN-EM
first-pass resize. So invocation N's approach 0 landed on top of invocation
N-1's approach 0, and the rest of invocation N-1's archives were orphaned from
a manifest that no longer mentioned them.

MEASURED on the run that filed the issue (an open PDK, a real front-door run,
2026-09-07): 12:37 wrote `approach0` sha b545fd04... 7913 B and `approach1`
100012 B carrying the two `[INFO DRT-0702] Post-route verification: 0
violation(s).` lines — the proof the design routed clean; 12:44 wrote
`approach0` sha 87ae65dd..., ALSO 7913 B; at 13:01 `approach1` went 100012 ->
242545 B. Two facts make this a reporting-integrity defect rather than an
untidy directory:

  * both approach-0 files were the SAME SIZE, so no size and no count could
    see the loss — only a digest can; and
  * the manifest stayed internally SELF-CONSISTENT throughout (its recorded
    sha always equalled the file then on disk), so nothing in the tree
    signalled that a record had been destroyed.

Every assertion below that asks "is the earlier record still there" therefore
asks it with sha256, never with a size and never with a count.

WHAT THESE TESTS PIN, in both directions:

  1. two invocations into one out_dir keep BOTH archive sets, byte-identical
     to what each invocation wrote                          (the reproducer);
  2. the manifest references every invocation's approaches and names which
     invocation, and which approach of it, `openroad.log` duplicates;
  3. the first invocation's DRT-0702 evidence is reachable BY THE MANIFEST —
     not merely still somewhere on disk as an orphan;
  4. MUTATION: restart the invocation index (the pre-fix behaviour) and the
     second write is REFUSED by name — red if it silently overwrites;
  5. a directory an OLDER plugin wrote (pre-#2133 archive names) is recognised
     as invocation 0 and is not overwritten; and
  6. #2108's own invariants still hold across two invocations: `openroad.log`
     carries only the approach that shipped, and a `*.log` sweep of the PnR
     directory has not changed population.

THE COMPLETE CONSUMER SET of `openroad.approaches.json` at the time of writing,
established by `grep -rn "approaches\\.json\\|_PNR_APPROACH_MANIFEST\\|
_PNR_APPROACH_LOG_FMT\\|openroad\\.approach" .` over the whole repository, and
bound below over the plugin's `*.py` / `*.md` SOURCES:
`phase3_one_shot_runner.py` (the producer),
`test_issue2108_pnr_approach_log_survives_the_next_approach.py`, and this
module. Two further files NAME the archives in prose without reading them:
`def_stage_progression_check.py` and
`test_issue2116_global_route_marker_reads_only_the_canonical_log.py`, both of
which recount why #2108 chose the `.txt` suffix. No program reads the manifest
or the archives outside the three above, and no sweep of the PnR directory
reaches them: `def_stage_progression_check` swept `pnr_dir.rglob("*.log")`
until vibe-ic#2116 narrowed it to `rglob("openroad.log")`, so the archives are
outside it under BOTH the `.txt` suffix #2108 gave them and the narrowed glob.
`test_the_manifest_consumer_set_is_still_what_this_module_names` below binds
the whole set so it cannot rot silently.

No test here launches OpenROAD or a container. The fake `_docker_exec` below
emulates the shell's own `tee` semantics — it parses the tee target and the
`-a` flag out of the command the runner actually built — so the fixture stays
faithful to whichever sink the runner uses rather than to the one this test
was written against.
