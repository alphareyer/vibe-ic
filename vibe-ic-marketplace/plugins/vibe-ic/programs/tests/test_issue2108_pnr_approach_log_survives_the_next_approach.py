"""vibe-ic#2108 — a PnR approach must not destroy the previous approach's log.

`step_pnr` composes its OpenROAD command ONCE and re-runs it from a bounded
retry loop (over-util upsize, over-sparse downsize, ROUTING-FEEDBACK loosen
ladder). The command ends `... 2>&1 | tee <out_dir>/openroad.log`, and `tee`
without `-a` truncates its file at open, so approach N destroyed approach
N-1's log before writing a line of its own.

MEASURED on the run that filed the issue: six approaches, five of which
reached `[INFO DRT-0702] Post-route verification: 0 violation(s).`, and the
shipped tree could not show a reader that ANY of them had. The loss is
asymmetric — when a later approach ends worse than an earlier one, the
published record shows only the worse outcome and nothing in the tree
contradicts it.

WHAT THESE TESTS PIN, in both directions:

  1. an earlier approach's evidence is still READABLE from the PnR directory
     after a later approach has run                        (the reproducer);
  2. `openroad.log` itself still carries ONLY the approach that shipped — the
     guard against "fixing" this with `tee -a`, which would let an early
     approach's CTS / crash text vouch for a final approach that never
     produced it;
  3. the archives are NOT swept up by `def_stage_progression_check`'s
     `pnr_dir.rglob("*.log")`, which demotes a `no-routing-geometry` error to
     a warning on a `DETAILED_ROUTE_NONFATAL:` marker found in ANY log there —
     the same laundering as (2), arriving through someone else's glob;
  4. the aggregate names which archive backs which approach; and
  5. a preservation FAILURE is recorded and printed, never swallowed.

No test here launches OpenROAD or a container. The fake `_docker_exec` below
emulates the shell's own `tee` semantics — it parses the tee target and the
`-a` flag out of the command the runner actually built — so the fixture stays
faithful to whichever sink the runner uses rather than to the one this test
was written against.
