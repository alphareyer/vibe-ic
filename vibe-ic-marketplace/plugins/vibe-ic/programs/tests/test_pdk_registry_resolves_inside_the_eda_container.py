"""A registry-declared PDK must resolve when the runner is INSIDE the image.

MEASURED DEFECT (2026-09-06, subservient x gf180mcuD, canonical front door
`vibe_ic_one_shot_runner.py` running inside ghcr.io/vibeic/vibeic-eda 0.3.46).
Phase 2 reached PASS_WITH_WAIVERS and Phase 3 halted on its very first act:

    [FAIL] --pdk gf180mcuD: declared in pdk_registry.json but its assets could
    not be resolved inside container 'vibeic-eda'
    (container_path='/foss/pdks/gf180mcuD'). REFUSING to fall back to sky130A

The refusal is CORRECT policy and stays.  What was wrong is that the assets
were there.  All six of that registry entry's declared paths matched exactly
one file each, at the exact path the probe was asking about, on the process's
OWN filesystem.  `_registry_glob_one` and `_pdk_config_from_registry` reached
the PDK only through `docker exec`, and there is no `docker` binary inside the
image, so every probe returned 127, every asset resolved to None, and a fully
present PDK was reported absent.

The repo already settled this exact question one layer over: `_read_pdk_text`
reads "Host read first (so a staged/host-local copy still wins), then the
container", for the same reason.  The registry resolver never got that order.

FIX (v1.17.79, then CORRECTED here).  v1.17.79 answered this by giving
`_registry_glob_one` its OWN local resolver, consulted before the container
and unconditionally.  That resolved the in-image case and broke the contract
one layer up: a second, container-blind oracle answers from whatever this
filesystem happens to carry, so three tests pinning "a DECLARED asset that
does not resolve is a REFUSAL" went `DID NOT RAISE SystemExit`.  A refusal
that depends on what the image happens to ship is not a refusal.

The route now lives at the ONE exec seam instead: `_local_exec_mode()` asks
whether a route to a container exists at all, and `_docker_exec_raw` runs the
same `bash -lc` probe on THIS filesystem when none does.  So every assertion
below still holds — a present asset resolves without docker — while the
resolver keeps asking the container it was handed, and a mocked container
still decides the answer.

§4.05 NO-LEAK — resolution can never be laxer than the container branch:
  * an absent root still resolves to None, so the caller still REFUSES;
  * a glob that matches nothing still resolves to None;
  * a candidate outside the PDK root is rejected, textually AND after
    symlink/`..` resolution — now on BOTH routes, because the predicate
    (`_registry_path_under_root`) sits at the one place both pass through.
    (The literal container branch had no containment at all before this.)

    vibe-ic#2100.  Every assertion below is about the LOCAL branch, and that
    branch is selected by exactly one predicate — `_container_exec.
    no_container_route()`, i.e. "there is no `docker` client on PATH".  This
    file used to state that condition only in its prose and then take whatever
    the machine happened to be, which made it a test about the HOST:

      * on a bare host with no Docker CLI it measured the local branch;
      * under `tools/ci/run_suite_in_eda_image.sh`, which BINDS the host's
        docker binary and socket into the container on purpose, `shutil.which`
        answers `/usr/bin/docker`, the CONTAINER branch runs, the deliberately
        absent `cza-no-such-container-000` is unreachable, and a present asset
        resolves to None.  MEASURED 2026-09-07 on 8HD-4 in both env arms:
        `test_glob_resolves_from_the_local_filesystem_without_docker` and
        `test_literal_path_resolves_from_the_local_filesystem` red, with
        "a present asset resolved to None" — a message about the harness.

    The NO-LEAK tests were worse off than the two reds: on such a host they
    PASSED for the wrong reason.  `None` came back because the container was
    unreachable, not because the local branch had refused, so the containment
    they exist to pin was never exercised.  Staging the condition is therefore
    a STRENGTHENING of this file, not a relaxation of it.

    `shutil.which` is substituted on `_container_exec`, which is where the one
    predicate reads it, and the phase-3 module's memoised answer is cleared on
    both sides of the test so no ordering can leak a cached route.
