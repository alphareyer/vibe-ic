"""test_issue2216_required_gate_eligibility.py

#2216: collecting RTL, and an independent semantic PASS on it, were being
conflated with "every required Program gate passed".

MEASURED before the fix, with the issue's own probe against the REAL collector
(`benchmark_io_adapter.collect`) on live main: a project whose owning gate
`rtl_gen` is PASS and whose in-scope downstream gate `rtl_validate` is FAIL
collects `ok=True`. The collector is RIGHT to do that — a failed candidate must
stay reviewable and repairable, and #2216 says so explicitly. The defect is one
step further on: nothing between that collection and the printed
`ACCEPTED by PROGRAM gates` ever asks whether a REQUIRED IN-SCOPE gate failed.

ONE ROOT CAUSE. The accept path asks four artefact questions -- runner-owned
project, reviewed-hash identity, Phase-1 provenance, and the RTL-OWNING gate --
then makes a claim about EVERY gate. `_required_gate_ledger` is the missing
question.

SCOPE IS READ, NOT INVENTED. `step_preflight.RUNNER_PLANS` is the runner's own
(site, flow-step-span) table -- the same one `--exit-step` prunes against -- and
the run declares its own `exit`. With exit 2: `rtl_gen`(1) and `rtl_validate`
(2,3) are in scope; `sim`(4), `yosys_synth`(9) and `dft_lec_chain`(11-13) are
not.

WHY THE BLOCKING PREDICATE IS DELIBERATELY NARROW. Measured on the published
VerilogEval-Human corpus, 61 accepted rows carry 163 FAIL steps
(`lec_equivalence` 61, `final_audit` 47, `sdc_gen` 43, `yosys_synth` 12) and
NOT ONE is an in-scope site gate. A blanket "any FAIL blocks" rule would refuse
all 61 -- that is the all-history-green rule #2216 forbids, and those
out-of-exit failures are #2208's producer/consumer defect. They stay visible in
the ledger and block nothing.

THREE-VALUED ON PURPOSE. `rtl_validate` is BLOCKED on 44 of those 61 rows and
absent on the other 17: a required in-scope gate that never reported. Calling
that ELIGIBLE is the defect; calling it INELIGIBLE would refuse 61 published
candidates for a state nobody measured. It is NOT_MEASURED, and the accepting
message now says so instead of claiming the gates passed.

Every fixture is synthesised here. No design, PDK, vendor or IP identifier
appears in this file, and no oracle, harness or golden is read.
