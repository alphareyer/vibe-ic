"""R-0915-86 (1) — the shared table reader and the direction rule.

`_step_verdict_table` is the ONE place `real_ic_gate` and `audit_replay` turn a
compliance artefact into a per-step table and decide which way a step moved.
Two properties have to hold or both programs lie in the same way:

  1. BOTH artefact shapes read as the SAME table. `flow_compliance_check` writes
     `verdict`/`step_counts`/`command_argv` into
     `reports/audit/phase23_completion_audit.json` and `overall`/`counts` into
     the path given to `--json`, with an element-for-element identical `steps[]`
     (MEASURED 2026-09-16 on the frozen subservient_r26 snapshot: 69 steps,
     identical 18-key records, identical counts). A reader that knew one shape
     would read the other as a table with no verdict — i.e. would rank it
     NON_GREEN and report a catastrophic regression that never happened.

  2. The direction rule adds NO vocabulary. It is `verdict`'
     classification, which adjudicates BY SUBTRACTION so a word invented
     tomorrow lands somewhere without anyone remembering to come here. The
     load-bearing test below plants a word registered NOWHERE and requires a
     direction for it.

CALIBRATION (R-0915-86 (3)) is the pair of tests at the end: the differ must
FIRE on a planted flip and stay SILENT on an identical table. An instrument that
has not been shown to do both may not judge.
