"""Regression for #2094 — the expert pack a REGISTERED class gets.

THE DEFECT, MEASURED. The Phase-1 expert track assembled a hand-off pack for a
design whose registered `ic_class` was a crypto accelerator, and the pack
carried `target_module: null`, `interface_contract: null` and five db_classes
none of which was crypto. Three of the five were pure retrieval artifacts: the
input sentence "the multipliers are implemented in a serial-parallel fashion"
(describing two internal field multipliers) scored the `serial-parallel-
multiplier` entry — craft about authoring a golden for a serial-parallel
multiplier DESIGN — into a crypto pack. A LITERAL PHRASE COLLISION is not a
design-family match. The pack was handed on anyway, so a 46-expectation review
was recorded as having had an expert pack in hand when the pack held nothing
about the design's class.

THREE THINGS ARE FIXED, AND EACH IS PINNED HERE BOTH WAYS:

  1. CLASS-FIRST — the registered ic_class SELECTS the candidate entries; the
     lexical phrase score only RANKS within them. Positive: a profiled class
     gets only in-class entries. Negative (the MUTATION): with the class-first
     rule removed — the same call with `ic_class=None` — the collision comes
     straight back. A confinement that cannot be seen to bite is not one.

  2. REFUSAL — a pack for a PROFILED class with no target module and no
     interface contract is stamped `NOT_ASSEMBLED` and says why. Negative: give
     it a contract and the same code stamps `ASSEMBLED`, so the status is
     computed rather than constant.

  3. THE UNPROFILED CLASS IS UNTOUCHED — a registered class the DB does not
     profile retrieves exactly what it retrieved before (byte-identical hit
     list) and its pack is not refused. Refusing on an unprofiled class would
     score the absence of a profile as the design's deficiency, and the
     registry says of the classifier's terminal catch-all, in its own words,
     that designs landing there "are UNCLASSIFIED, not classified".

Plus the DECLARED-GAP invariant: every name in `ic_class_registry.json` appears
in `registered_class_profiles`, profiled or explicitly null. A registered class
that is simply absent is how "not yet profiled" goes silent.

chip-AGNOSTIC: the fixtures below are synthetic; the one real-corpus fact used
is the collision SENTENCE SHAPE, which names no chip, vendor, SKU or node.
