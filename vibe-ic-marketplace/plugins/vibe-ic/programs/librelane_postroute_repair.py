"""librelane_postroute_repair.py — step 32 (post-route repair) on LibreLane (T102).

Selected by `phase3/librelane_switch.json` (`"32": "librelane"`) through
`librelane_contract.selected_mode`. With `direct` (switch absent, or naming
other steps) `phase3_one_shot_runner` runs `step_signoff_spef_repair` and the
DRV wire-length escalation exactly as before and nothing here is called.

WHAT RUNS INSTEAD
=================
The routed database is bridged into a LibreLane State
(`librelane_contract.state_from_direct`) and the repair is the plugin step
`Vibeic.PostRouteRepair` (`librelane_plugins/librelane_plugin_vibeic/
postroute_repair.py`): fork `estimate_parasitics -detailed_routing` on the
router's own extracted wires, `repair_design`, `repair_timing -setup`, then
`-hold`, legalization of the changed cells only, supply connection, ECO
`detailed_route -nets` of the touched nets, re-verify. One run of it is one
CANDIDATE. Every candidate, and the input, is measured the same way:
`OpenROAD.RCX` then `OpenROAD.STAPostPNR` (every STA corner) in the sign-off
scene (the deck's SDC plus the sign-off STA's flat-OCV derate).

WHO DECIDES
===========
`_ppa/closure.py`. The actuator `timing.repair_setup` (config/
ppa_actuator_registry.yaml) is EXECUTABLE: its wrapper is this program's
`actuate` subcommand, its parameters (setup/hold margin, buffer budgets,
repair_tns) are a declared ladder, and the domains it re-measures —
`timing.setup`, `timing.hold`, `timing.drv`, `antenna.violations` — are this
program's `measure` subcommand over the ADOPTED candidate. The input route is
measured on the same instruments: the plugin step in census-only mode
(`VIBEIC_PRR_CENSUS_ONLY`, `check_antennas`), then RCX + STAPostPNR. The controller
promotes a candidate only on a measured improvement of its objective with no
regression in any re-measured domain, and rolls back otherwise. T98's finding
(a DRV repair that took SS setup from +3.33 to +0.14 because it was the first
candidate that passed DRV) cannot recur: setup is re-measured on every
candidate and a setup regression rolls the candidate back.

THE IMPLEMENTATION ROOT IS A POINTER
====================================
The closure snapshots and restores its implementation root, so the root holds
exactly two small files: `context.json` (how to run a candidate: project,
image, PDK mount, resolved configs) and `current.json` (the adopted State and
its measurement, bound by sha256). Candidate States live in LibreLane's own
step directories, which are never overwritten, so a rollback is keeping the
previous pointer: nothing is re-read or re-routed to undo a candidate. The
ledger of every candidate (adopted or not, and why) lives outside the root.

HARD REFUSALS, BEFORE A CANDIDATE CAN BE ADOPTED
================================================
* supply ownership (F24): `pg_supply_pin_ownership_check` on the candidate's
  own DEF. A proven off-supply pin keeps the pointer where it was;
* antenna, by the step-26 instrument (`OpenROAD.CheckAntennas`): a candidate
  with more violating nets OR pins than the state it was built from, or an
  uncounted dimension, keeps the pointer where it was;
* the repair step's own `check_placement` (it fails the step);
* router DRC: the fork's scoped `detailed_route -nets` refuses a route with
  more whole-design violations than it was given (DRT-0712), which fails the
  candidate's step; the ledger records it as TOOL_REFUSED.

A step failure is TOOL_REFUSED (rc 0, the pointer stays, the next rung runs)
only when its log carries one of the step's own named refusals
(`[VIBEIC_]PRR_*_REFUSED` / `_RESIDUE`, check_placement's included, and
`LL_PRR_FANOUT_LIMIT_BROKEN`) and no crash. A signal, a stall, or an unexplained failure is
ACTUATOR_FAILED / NOT_MEASURED (rc 2); a step failure of that kind gets one
retry in the `hold_first` move order.

chip-AGNOSTIC: no design, PDK, corner, cell or net literal. Every value comes
from the resolved LibreLane config, the direct deck's own files or the
registry's declared ladder.
