"""librelane_route.py — step 21 (global + detailed routing) on LibreLane (lane mig99).

Selected by `phase3/librelane_switch.json` `"21"` (`librelane` or `dual`)
through `librelane_contract.selected_mode`. With `direct` (switch absent, or
naming other steps) `phase3_one_shot_runner` runs its PnR session exactly as
before and nothing here is called.

Otherwise the deck's step-21 region -- `R._PNR_ROUTE_BEGIN` (after the
DRT-0305 PG-net cleanup) to `R._PNR_RESUME_ELIDE_END` (the route checkpoint)
-- runs on LibreLane instead:

1. a checkpoint session writes the pre-route ODB/DEF/netlist: the deck up to
   `_PNR_ROUTE_BEGIN` when steps 19/20 are direct, or, when they are on
   LibreLane too, the deck resumed from their handed-over `post_hold.odb` up
   to the same line (`librelane_cts_hold.execute(..., after_handoff=...)`);
2. the checkpoint is bridged (`state_from_direct`) into the image's own Chip
   segment `OpenROAD.GlobalRouting .. OpenROAD.FillInsertion` (global route,
   antenna check, post-GRT design and timing repair, antenna repair, detailed
   route with its own antenna loop, the route checkers), with
   `Vibeic.NamedViolationReroute` right after the detailed route; every step
   works on the ODB, so no routed state crosses a session as DEF;
3. with `dual`, the deck's own region runs on the same checkpoint (and each
   declared seed as one more LibreLane arm, `Vibeic.DetailedRoutingSeeded`);
   every arm is measured by one instrument and the selection follows review70's
   order (`select`);
4. the selected ODB/DEF go to `routed_preantenna.{odb,def}` and the router's
   own marker report to `routed_router.drc.rpt`, sha256-bound in
   `reports/phase3/librelane_route_handoff.json`; the tools' logs are appended
   to `openroad.log`, bracketed, so every log reader downstream reads what the
   router printed;
5. the deck resumes from the routed ODB after `_PNR_RESUME_ELIDE_END`: the same
   deck the fatal-signal resume runs (post-route repair, the antenna and PG
   residual stages, write_routed).

Like `librelane_cts_hold`, every function that needs the runner's machinery
takes the runner MODULE as `R` and never imports it.

chip-AGNOSTIC: no design, PDK, corner, layer or cell literal. Every LibreLane
config value carries its declared source.
