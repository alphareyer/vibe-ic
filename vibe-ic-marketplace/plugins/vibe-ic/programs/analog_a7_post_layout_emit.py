"""analog_a7_post_layout_emit.py — the deterministic A7 producer.

A7 (post-layout resimulation) had no producer: the runner WAIVED it to the
`analog-extraction-resim` skill, which hand-built a Magic RC recipe
(`magic_extract_spice_emit.build_extraction_tcl`). The tool does that job, so
the tool does it here:

  1. EXTRACT with LibreLane `Magic.RCX` (`python3 -m librelane.steps run`,
     through `librelane_contract.run_chain`) on the A5 GDS — one run per
     `ngspice` extraction style the A5 layout's OWN Magic technology declares
     (`extract / style ngspice variants (...)`), the device-only `lvs` variant
     excluded because it extracts no parasitics.
  2. AUDIT what Magic wrote with `magic_extract_spice_emit
     .audit_extracted_netlist`: 0 R and 0 C is refused (a re-simulation of it
     is the pre-layout circuit again, a false 0 % degradation); the depth
     achieved (RC / C_ONLY) is recorded.
  3. RESIMULATE with A4's own machinery (`analog_real_corner_sweep
     ._run_ngspice`): the block's A3 testbench, once as delivered (pre) and
     once with the extracted netlist behind a wrapper subcircuit that keeps
     the A3 port order (post), in the same container. The transient stops at
     the end of the last window a `meas` card reads, plus one sample clock
     (`measurement_span`), and every simulation records the SAME planning
     budget (`simulation_budget`). A stopped run is NOT_MEASURED with the
     time it reached; budget exhaustion requires proof of enforcement (T130).
  4. WRITE `phase3/analog/<block>/pre_vs_post.json` — one spec row per
     measurement per extraction style — naming the extracted netlist as its
     post-layout evidence. The A7 gate owns the verdict.

WHAT THE PRODUCER GUARANTEES BEYOND "IT RAN" (q7, T109):
  * NON-INTERFERENCE. Its working decks live in its own area,
    `phase3/librelane/analog/<block>/a7_resim/`, never under
    `phase3/analog/<block>/`: A3's gates rglob `phase3/analog` for `*.sp`,
    and 11 resimulation decks there grew one gate's population 13 -> 24 and
    flipped another to FAIL. Only `pre_vs_post.json` and
    `a7_post_layout.json` are written beside the block.
  * NO SILENT DROP. The extracted body sits one level down (`xrcx`) in the
    wrapper, so a testbench probe `v(<dut>.<n>)` of an internal net is
    rewritten to `v(<dut>.xrcx.<n>)` when `<n>` is a net of that style's
    extracted netlist (to the wrapper's node when `<n>` is one of the
    extracted subcircuit's ports). A probe whose net is ABSENT after
    extraction is taken out of the post deck and its measurement listed in
    `not_compared` with the reason. Any other measurement the pre run had and
    the post run lacks refuses `A7_POST_MEASUREMENT_MISSING`.
  * DEVICE INVENTORY. Each style's extracted PDK devices must equal the A3
    netlist's: for a model the layout's Magic technology declares a
    `mosfet`/`msubcircuit` device, the sum of w*m per (model, l) (Magic may
    split fingers); for every other model the (model, w, l) multiset with m
    expanded. A difference refuses `A7_RCX_DEVICE_INVENTORY_MISMATCH` — a
    resimulation of a circuit that lost or gained a device is not a
    post-layout measurement of this one.

Nothing here grades, and nothing here invents a value: the PDK and the Magic
technology come from A5's `layout_provenance.json` (the technology the layout
was drawn with), the ports and model binding from the A3 netlist, the stimulus
from the A3 testbench.

Opt-in: the analog runner calls this producer only when
`phase3/librelane_switch.json` selects `librelane` (or `dual`) for step `A7`.

Exit codes: 0 written; 1 the tool ran and its product is refused (named in
`a7_post_layout.json`); 2 honest gap (an upstream artefact this step reads is
absent); 69 environment refusal (the tool could not be reached); 75 a
simulation stopped before measurement (NOT_MEASURED; reason from evidence).

#: WHY THE RUN IS CUT TO WHAT IT MEASURES. MEASURED (lane mig109, 8hd-3,
#: delta_sigma on ihp-sg13g2): the A3 testbench asks for `tran 5n 28673000n`
#: -- 28,673 clocks of a 1 MHz modulator, a record `record_constraints` sized
#: for the A4 GRADED measurement -- while every windowed `meas` card it
#: carries reads `from=523240n to=1025000n`, about 500 clocks. The pre-layout
#: run alone went 32.5 h without finishing, with five post-layout styles
#: queued behind it, because it ran ~28x past the last point any card reads.
#: A7 compares what the deck MEASURES, so the transient stops at the end of
#: the last measurement window plus a stated settle margin, unless a card
#: genuinely needs a longer record (named, with its source, below).
#:
#: The margin is ONE period of the deck's own sample clock (the one top-level
#: pulse source), so the window's last sample is an interior point of the
#: record and not the run's final breakpoint; a deck with no such clock gets
#: `_SETTLE_FRACTION` of the window end instead.
_SETTLE_CLOCKS = 1
_SETTLE_FRACTION = 0.01

#: The planning budget recorded for each A7 simulation when the block declares none: a
#: floor for start-up (model load, operating point) plus a per-clock cost.
#: MEASURED on 8hd-3 (32 cores, load < 3, image vibeic-eda 0.3.79): the
#: delta_sigma pre-layout deck advances ~9.2 s of wall per simulated 1 us
#: clock. The default allows 30 s per clock -- about three times that, because
#: an extracted netlist carries hundreds of R and C the pre-layout run does
#: not -- and applies the SAME budget to the pre deck and every post deck, so
#: no style is given more time than another. A project that knows better
#: states it in `phase3/analog/simulation_budgets.json` (`declared_budget`).
