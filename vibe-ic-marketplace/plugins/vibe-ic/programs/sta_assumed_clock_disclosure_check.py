"""sta_assumed_clock_disclosure_check.py — a timing sign-off that was measured
against a clock the DESIGN NEVER STATED must say so, in the record.

THE DEFECT (measured, vibe-ic#2091, opentitan_aes x sky130A)
============================================================
The input states no target clock period for the sky130A build.  The run signed
off post-route timing against 10 ns anyway and reported WNS -42.140 ns.  Every
artefact of that sign-off — the SDC, the STA reports, the corner record — is
phrased as a verdict about a specification.  None of them contains a line
saying the specification does not exist.

That is not a timing bug; it is a PROVENANCE bug with a timing consequence.
A reader cannot tell "this design missed its target" from "this design was
never given a target and the flow supplied one".  The two demand opposite
actions: the first is a closure problem, the second is a Phase-1 question.

WHAT THIS GATE ASSERTS
======================
When `clock_target_provenance` reports ``assumed: true`` for this run, the
post-route sign-off record must carry BOTH:

  1. a machine-readable ``clock_period_assumed: true``, so a downstream
     consumer can branch on it without parsing English; and
  2. the disclosure SENTENCE — `clock_target_provenance.ASSUMED_DISCLOSURE`,
     imported, never re-typed here, so the emitter and this checker cannot
     drift into asserting different strings.

Both, deliberately.  A flag with no sentence is invisible in every report a
human reads; a sentence with no flag cannot be enforced anywhere else.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
===================
It never inspects slack, never compares a period against anything, and never
turns a timing FAIL into a PASS or the reverse.  A run whose period IS design-
owned passes this gate unconditionally — the gate has an opinion about
disclosure only.

EXIT CODES
==========
  0  PASS       — either the period is design-owned, or it is assumed AND
                  fully disclosed.
  1  FAIL       — the period is assumed and the record does not disclose it.
  2  NOT CHECKED— no provenance report and/or no sign-off record on disk.
                  Absence of an input is NOT a pass (vibe-ic#1140): a gate that
                  reports 0 on an empty project certifies nothing.

STEP 23 ON THE TOOL (F15)
=========================
When step 23 runs `librelane` or `dual`, the sign-off is STAPostPNR's, and its
record (`librelane_signoff.SIGNOFF_RECORD`, bound to the tool state it names)
is one of the records that must disclose an assumed period; the records the
step's other gates write still must too. A tool sign-off that cannot be read
(`librelane_signoff.step23_tool_arm`) REFUSES (rc 1): the disclosure is about
a sign-off, and an unreadable sign-off is not one that needed no disclosure.
