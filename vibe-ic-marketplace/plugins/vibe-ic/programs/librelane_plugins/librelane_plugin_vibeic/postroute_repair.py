"""Step 32's custom step: the post-detailed-route repair (T102).

LibreLane's Classic/Chip flows repair timing only BEFORE detailed routing
(`OpenROAD.ResizerTimingPostGRT`); nothing runs repair_timing on the routed
design.  `Vibeic.PostRouteRepair` does, between `OpenROAD.DetailedRouting`
and `OpenROAD.RCX`, on the routed ODB:

1. parasitics from the router's own wires: OpenRCX with every declared
   `RCX_RULESETS` entry, each SPEF read back onto the STA corners its pattern
   names, then the vibeic/OpenROAD fork's `estimate_parasitics
   -detailed_routing` (without it the resizer's repair moves fall back to
   Steiner estimates, or segfault on stock OpenROAD).  The fork flag is
   probed against a bogus control flag; an OpenROAD that rejects it refuses
   `VIBEIC_PRR_TOOL_INCAPABLE`;
2. `repair_design`, then `repair_timing -setup`, then `repair_timing -hold`
   (hold after setup, never at setup's expense);
3. the changed cells legalized (LibreLane's own `dpl.tcl`), every created
   cell connected to its declared supply (`global_connect` with the rules the
   database carries plus `VIBEIC_PRR_PG_RULES_TCL`), and an ECO route: only
   the nets touching a created, resized or moved cell lose their wires and
   are routed again (`detailed_route -nets`);
4. antenna residue: when the ECO route added antenna-violating nets,
   OpenROAD's `repair_antennas` (the PDK's DIODE_CELL) and a scoped route of
   the new diodes' nets only;
5. re-verify: the ECO route's DRC count, `check_antennas`, and the
   before/after census on the same parasitics.

It JUDGES NOTHING and adopts nothing.  One run is one CANDIDATE; the
candidate is measured by `OpenROAD.RCX` + `OpenROAD.STAPostPNR` and adopted
or rolled back by `programs/librelane_postroute_repair.py` through
`_ppa/closure.py` (the `timing.repair_setup` actuator).  Rollback is keeping
the input state: this step never writes over it.

Shipped with the plugin, not the vibeic/librelane fork: the step is vibe-ic's
closure policy on top of the tools, and its parameters come from vibe-ic's
actuator registry.
