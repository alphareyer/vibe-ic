clock_plan_check.py — Step 16 (Clock planning) substance gate.

Anti-fabrication mandate
------------------------
The Step 16 flow gate previously trusted ``files_exist`` ONLY: it passed the
instant ``phase3/stage3/cts/clock_plan.json`` appeared, with ZERO verification
that the file describes a usable clock plan. A plan that names no clock, or a
clock with no period, would have sailed through — and CTS (Step 19) would then
build a tree against an under-specified plan.

This checker performs REAL DETERMINISTIC SUBSTANCE verification of the produced
clock-plan artefact:

  1. Parse ``phase3/stage3/cts/clock_plan.json``. It MUST exist, be non-empty,
     and be valid JSON. Absent / empty / unparseable => honest FAIL (rc=1) —
     never a vacuous pass on absence.
  2. Normalise the plan into a list of clock records regardless of which schema
     shape the producer used:
       - a ``clocks`` (or ``clock_list`` / ``defined_clocks``) array of objects,
         each with name + period/frequency + source pin/port, OR
       - the runner's minimal single-clock shape
         (``primary_clock`` + a top-level ``period``/``frequency`` + a top-level
         source ``port``/``pin``/``source``).
  3. Require >= 1 clock defined. An empty plan => FAIL.
  4. Each clock MUST have:
       - a POSITIVE period (ns), derived directly from a period field OR
         converted from a positive frequency (period_ns = 1000 / freq_MHz,
         period_ns = 1e9 / freq_Hz). A clock with no period AND no frequency,
         or a non-positive value, => FAIL.  (Positivity is a structural physical
         fact, NOT a fabricated chip-specific threshold.)
       - a source pin or port (a non-empty net/port/pin string). A clock with no
         source object => FAIL.
  5. If an SDC exists (phase3/.../constraints, the pnr dir, the phase2 fpga
     constraints, or any ``*.sdc`` under the project), parse every
     ``create_clock`` in it and verify each constrained clock NAME appears in
     the plan. A dropped clock (in SDC but missing from the plan) => FAIL. This
     is the real backend failure this gate guards: a multi-clock design whose
     plan silently forgets a clock domain.

Verdicts
--------
* PASS   (rc=0) — >= 1 clock, every clock has a positive period and a source
                  object, and (if an SDC exists) no SDC clock is dropped.
* FAIL   (rc=1) — plan absent/empty/unparseable, no clock defined, a clock with
                  no/non-positive period, a clock with no source object, or an
                  SDC ``create_clock`` not present in the plan.
* WAIVED (rc=0) — ``waivers.json`` declares the step waived (ticket + reason).
* SKIP   (rc=2) — project dir not found (operational, not a design failure).

No numeric threshold the artefact/PDK does not provide is invented. The only
bounds applied are universal structural facts (period must be > 0; a clock must
have a source object) — stated explicitly in honest_notes. chip-AGNOSTIC: no
vendor / IC / tool literal is hard-coded.

# SDC create_clock harvesting (for dropped-clock detection)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Plan freshness — CONTENT-keyed, and only when the plan recorded its inputs
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# An earlier attempt at this keyed freshness on MTIME: the plan was called
# stale when any *.sdc — or `floorplan.def` / `placed.def` — had a newer
# mtime. Two things were wrong with it, and both are load-bearing:
#
#   1. MTIME DOES NOT SURVIVE COPYING. git does not restore mtimes, so on a
#      fresh checkout the ordering is whatever order the checkout wrote the
#      files in. Over the 17 tracked `clock_plan.json` files in this repo
#      (`git ls-files benchmark-data`), the mtime rule fired on SIX in one
#      reviewer's checkout and on FIVE in another worktree of the same commit —
#      identical bytes, different answer — every hit naming
#      `phase3/stage3/pnr/constraint.sdc`. A finding whose count depends on the
#      order git happened to write files in is not measuring the artefact.
#      Clone, copy, rsync and archive extraction are how this corpus and every
#      user project are distributed, so an mtime-keyed provenance finding is
#      noise on nearly every tree that reads it. Content-keyed, the same 17
#      files yield 0 findings deterministically, on every tree.
#   2. A DEF IS NOT AN INPUT TO THIS PLAN. The plan's clock records are built
#      from `create_clock` statements in the SDCs and from nothing else, so a
#      newer `floorplan.def` cannot make the plan wrong. Including the DEFs was
#      also the half of the producer/checker disagreement that lived on this
#      side (the producer compared against `primary_def`, the checker against
#      floorplan/placed).
#
# What replaces it: the plan RECORDS what it was derived from. The producer
# writes `derived_from` = {project-relative SDC path: sha256}, and this checker
# re-hashes exactly those recorded paths. Both sides use one definition
# (`_pl.clock_plan_input_sdcs` / `_pl.clock_plan_sdc_digests`), the comparison
# is on CONTENT, and a plan that records nothing yields NO finding — an absent
# provenance record is an absence of evidence, not evidence of staleness.
