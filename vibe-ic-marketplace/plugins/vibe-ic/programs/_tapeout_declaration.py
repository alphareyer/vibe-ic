"""_tapeout_declaration — the 18 physical questions a die answers about itself.

WHY A DECLARATION AT ALL
========================
Three of the general precheck's checks cannot be answered from the layout
alone. "Is the die the right size" is not a property of a GDS; it is an
AGREEMENT between a GDS and a number somebody wrote down. Same for "is there a
seal ring" (required by whom?) and "are any forbidden layers used" (forbidden
by whom?). Without a written-down side, those three checks have nothing to
compare against and can only ever report NOT_DETERMINED.

A design submitted to a shuttle gets that written-down side for free: the
operator's template PINS it, and step 0.5ic ingests it. A design doing its OWN
tape-out gets nothing, and until this module the flow had no place for it to
say what it had decided. That is the whole gap: the numbers were never
computed, they were never GOT — and for a self-tape-out there is nobody to get
them from, so they have to be DECLARED.

NOT_DETERMINED, NEVER A DEFAULT
===============================
Every unanswered field is the literal string `NOT_DETERMINED`. Not `null`, not
`0`, not an empty list, and above all not a plausible number.

A default is a fake number wearing a real number's clothes. It reads as an
answer at every downstream consumer, it survives into a report, and the one
thing it cannot do is be wrong in a way anybody notices. This tree has found
that shape repeatedly — an empty result indistinguishable from a clean one —
and the declaration is the place it would be cheapest to reintroduce, because
every one of these 18 fields has an obvious-looking value.

So: `blank_declaration()` fills all 18 with `NOT_DETERMINED`, `merge_answers()`
only ever replaces a field with something a human supplied, and there is no
code path anywhere in this module that invents a value. A consumer handed
`NOT_DETERMINED` must report NOT_DETERMINED — which is a non-pass — and that is
the intended and only behaviour.

AN AGENT'S ANSWER IS NOT A DECLARATION (R-0915-95, 2026-09-17)
==============================================================
Some of these questions are not about the design at all. `deliverable` — "is
what leaves this flow a DIE that will be fabricated, or a HARDMACRO that
somebody else will place" — is a decision by the party that takes delivery.
Nothing in a design's own documents answers it, and their SILENCE answers it
least of all.

MEASURED, and it is the whole reason a provenance exists here. On 2026-09-06
an agent authored `input/step_0_5ic_answers.json` for five designs and wrote
`deliverable` into each of them "cited from the input docs", inferring
HARDMACRO from the documents' silence about a pad ring. The files were
well-formed. Every other field in them was honest. And this module had no way
to tell an answer somebody was ENTITLED to give from an answer somebody had
WORKED OUT, because it recorded what was answered and never who answered it —
so an inference and a declaration were the same bytes.

`tapeout_declaration_check` reported PASS. `route_of` selected the IP
terminal. Every lane ran the IP route for ELEVEN DAYS, and an IP result was
published as an IC PASS. The owner ruled on 2026-09-17 (R-0915-95) that all
five are dies. No check in this tree could have caught it: there was nothing
wrong with the file.

So an owner-only question carries its own provenance, and an answer without
the owner's attestation is NOT A DECLARATION. `answer()` reports it
`NOT_DETERMINED` — refused, not believed, so nothing downstream can route on
it — and `owner_attestation_refusals()` names it `NOT_DECLARED` so the step
that asks the question HALTS with the question surfaced instead of proceeding
on an inference.

THE ATTESTATION IS A CLAIM, NOT A PROOF, and it is not trying to be one: a
citation can be typed by anyone with the file open. What it cannot be is
SILENT. Before this, an inference reached the route with nothing written down
at all, and eleven days is what that cost. An attribution somebody has to
write, name and cite is a thing a reviewer can check and an author has to
stand behind; the silence was not.

WHERE THE 18 COME FROM — DERIVED, NOT INVENTED
==============================================
Each question exists because a REAL CONSUMER in this tree reads it. The
`consumer` field on every question names that consumer, so a question nobody
reads is visible as such rather than being carried forever because it once
seemed sensible.

  SECTION 2A — DIE SIZE (7).
      `die_area` / `core_area` / `fp_sizing` are the three keys
      `_submission_template.py` discovers a shuttle slot file BY
      (`DIE_AREA_KEY`, `CORE_AREA_KEY`, `FP_SIZING_KEY`) — i.e. the three an
      operator pins when there IS an operator. The other four are what the
      pure-geometry checks compare against: which cell must be the top, where
      the die's lower-left must be, what the database unit must be, and
      whether this deliverable is a die at all.
  SECTION 2B — PAD RING (8).
      `_pad_ring.REQUIRED_VARS` — 13 variables, which are upstream's own pad
      placer's names, verbatim. Grouped into the 8 things a HUMAN decides: the
      four per-side lists are one decision (which pads, in which order, on
      which side) and the three rotations are one decision (the orientations).
      The grouping is stated here so the 13:8 gap is a recorded reading and not
      a miscount.
  SECTION 2C — SEAL RING (3).
      The three inputs `sealring/sealring_verify.py` and `die_finishing_gen.py`
      already take: whether a ring is required, which PDK script builds it, and
      which marker layer must end up carrying geometry (`SEAL_MARKER`).

TWO CONTRACT FIELDS, AND WHY THEY ARE NOT IN THE 18
===================================================
`forbidden_layers` is required by the general precheck's forbidden-layer check.
`synthesis_area_budget` is required by the synthesis-area comparison. Neither
belongs to the three physical-deliverable sections, so both are carried at the
top level rather than being pushed into a section to make a tidier count. A
field filed under a heading it does not belong to is a small lie that later
gets quoted as a finding.

The area field is a typed union, never a sentinel overloaded as a waiver:

* `{status: LIMIT, max_die_dimensions_um: [W, H]}` is an explicit ceiling;
* `{status: NOT_APPLICABLE, rationale: ...}` is an explicit disposition;
* `NOT_DETERMINED` is unanswered and is never read as either of the above.

THE PAD REFUSALS ARE HONOURED, NOT RESTATED
===========================================
`_pad_ring.py` already refuses rather than improvising, in the places upstream
does — a side whose pad widths exceed its edge, leftover space that is not an
integer multiple of the minimum site width, a site name that is missing or is
not `CLASS PAD` — and it already emits each refusal as a RULE ID in
`reports/phase3/padring.json` where upstream's TCL emits a line of prose and
exits 1. Nothing here re-implements or relaxes any of that. Section 2B exists
to give those refusals their INPUTS: `PAD_CONFIG_VARIABLE_ABSENT` is the
refusal a `NOT_DETERMINED` in this section produces, which is the correct
outcome and not a gap.

chip-AGNOSTIC: no vendor, foundry, process node, SKU or design name. The only
fixed strings are upstream's own variable names and this flow's relative paths.

# WHO IS ENTITLED TO ANSWER A QUESTION (#2070)

# Nineteen of the twenty questions ask the DESIGN about itself. One does
# not. `database_unit_um` asks what the TECHNOLOGY FILE declares, and a design
# has no standing to answer that: the number is a property of the PDK the run
# targets, published by that PDK's own cell GDS stream.
#
# MEASURED, and this is why it is a defect and not a nicety. Two designs in the
# corpus each name TWO open PDK families in L1, and the pinned image's tech
# LEFs declare DIFFERENT database units for them — `DATABASE MICRONS 2000`
# (0.0005 um) for one family, `DATABASE MICRONS 1000` (0.001 um) for the other.
# One answers file drives run trees on BOTH, so any single scalar written there
# is wrong for one of the two runs. The designs correctly answered
# NOT_DETERMINED and cited both measurements — which is the right answer to a
# question that should never have been put to them.
#
# The LEF measurements above describe a DIFFERENT database; they are not the
# authority for GDSII UNITS. The stream value is transcribed per run from the
# cell GDS of the run's own `--pdk`, with its path and UNITS record. A design answer
# that DISAGREES with the run's technology is refused BY NAME, with both values
