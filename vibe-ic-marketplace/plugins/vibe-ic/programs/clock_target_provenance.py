"""clock_target_provenance.py — say WHERE the clock period a run signs off
against came from, and mark it ASSUMED when the design never stated one.

THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES (measured, vibe-ic#2091, opentitan_aes x sky130A)
=======================================================================
The whole opentitan_aes input states no target clock period for the sky130A
build.  The only frequency anywhere in it is a reference point attached to an
entropy-rate figure::

    input/docs/aes_README.md:36
      "...max entropy consumption rates ranging from 343 Mbit/s to
       0.042 Mbit/s (at 100 MHz)."

Phase 1's L8 nevertheless shipped ``clk_i`` at ``period_ns: 10.0`` and the run
signed off post-route timing against it — WNS reached -42.140 ns.  Nowhere in
the SDC, the STA reports or the sign-off record does a single line say that the
10 ns is not a specification.  A reader of that verdict has no way to tell a
design that MISSED its target from a design that was never given one.

`_resolve_clock_spec` in the Phase-3 runner already walks a documented ladder
of period sources, ending in a last-resort plugin literal.  What it does NOT do
is report WHICH rung answered — it returns a bare float.  So the difference
between "the design declared this" and "the plugin supplied this because the
design did not" is erased at the one call every downstream consumer reads.

WHAT THIS PROGRAM DOES
======================
It re-walks the same ladder for the purpose of PROVENANCE ONLY and returns the
tier that answered, its citation, and — the load-bearing field — ``assumed``.

It deliberately does NOT resolve the period for the flow.  Resolution stays
where it is; this is an additive disclosure.  Two readers of the same project
must not be able to disagree about the number, so when the caller already has
the resolved period it passes it in and this program only classifies it.

THE TIERS, highest authority first, matching `_resolve_clock_spec`:

    staged_sdc            input/constraints/*.sdc, input/reference_flow/**.sdc
    declared_pdk_table    a period-keyed table row matching this run's library
    phase2_emitted_sdc    a create_clock Phase 2 already wrote
    l8_declared           L8 clock_domains[] / clocks[] carrying a period
    doc_prose             an L9/L1 `-period <num>` statement
    config_json           CLOCK_PERIOD in a config.json
    plugin_default        NOTHING IN THE DESIGN SAID SO   <-- assumed = True

``assumed`` is True for exactly one tier.  Every other tier cites a file the
design owns, and a caller that reports "the design declared X" about them is
telling the truth.

SUFFICIENCY: WHY THIS ASSUMES AND DECLARES RATHER THAN REFUSING
==============================================================
`phase1_sufficiency_check`'s own severity model settles this, and it is worth
quoting because the alternative reading is defensible until you read it::

    ADVISORY : warn only ... NEVER blocking (clock/reset is advisory even on a
               sequential design)
    ... the deterministic gate never blocks on clock/reset.

So the flow's own definition of sufficiency says a missing clock target is an
ADVISORY, not a REQUIRED fact — the deterministic track must not refuse the
run over it.  The IC-expert dialogue track ASKS (a plain-language question,
which `phase1_sufficiency_check` now emits), and the doc-only Path-B track
proceeds with the value RECORDED AS AN ASSUMPTION.  That is this program's
contract: never invent silently, never refuse on the deterministic track.

``would_have_stated`` carries the sentence the input would have had to contain
for the value to be a specification, so the assumption is actionable and not
just labelled.

HONESTY BOUNDARY (§4.05)
========================
Only the design INPUT and the run's own generated artefacts are read; no
oracle, harness or golden.  Nothing is defaulted here — when no tier answers,
``period_ns`` is None and ``tier`` is ``not_determined``.  A prose statement is
consulted through `_prose_polarity` (the repo's one negation vocabulary), so a
sentence that RETRACTS a period is not published as a declaration.
