"""analog_a8_hardmacro_emit.py — A8 PRODUCER for an ANALOG block: emit the real
hardmacro abstract kit from the block's own signed-off layout.

WHY THIS EXISTS, MEASURED. A8's gate consumes `analog/hardmacro/<block>/` and
its LEF is what step 14 (floorplan) needs to reserve area for an analog macro —
without it OpenROAD refuses the digital top with `ORD-2013: no LEF master`. Two
producers were shipped and NEITHER could serve an analog block:

  * `digital_hardmacro_gen` writes a REAL abstract, by Magic, through the PDK's
    own magicrc — but it makes a DEF a precondition (exit 1, "no DEF"), because
    it derives a digital macro's pins and obstruction from the placed DEF. An
    analog block has no DEF and never will; it is drawn, not placed.
  * the runner's deterministic stub writes a 100x100 LEF with no pins. It exists
    so the flow can be exercised, and its own text says so.

So the analog track's only route to an abstract was the stub, and A8 sat at
VACUOUS_PASS ("defer to skill") while Phase 3 stayed blocked on the missing
master. The capability was never absent: `lef write -hide` reads the pins from
the layout's own port labels and needs no DEF at all. Measured on this
campaign's LDO: 4 pins, real SIZE, real OBS, 1754 bytes, from the sign-off GDS.

WHAT IT EMITS, per block, into `phase3/analog/hardmacro/<block>/`:
    <block>.lef   Magic `lef write -hide` on the block's sign-off GDS
    <block>.gds   the sign-off GDS itself (the abstract's implementation)
    <block>.v     the interface module — ports from the block's own topology IR
    <block>.lib   interface Liberty — pg_pins for the declared rails, and one
                  pin per remaining port

DIRECTIONS. An analog port has no digital direction, and inventing one would be
a design claim this program is not entitled to make. Every non-rail port is
therefore `inout`, which is what an analog macro's interface IS; the rails come
from the block's own `rails` declaration and become PG pins.

Exit codes: 0 emitted (or already complete), 1 a named precondition of the KIT
is missing (no GDS / no port list), 2 a CAPABILITY is absent (no Magic, no
magicrc) — disclosed, never a silent success.

chip-AGNOSTIC: no chip, vendor, SKU or process literal; the PDK arrives as the
magicrc the design's own PDK root provides.

    # THE CARVE STAYS ON, AND HERE IS THE HYPOTHESIS THAT DIED.
    #
    # Chip-level Magic extraction reports thousands of `Illegal overlap
    # between obsmN and metalN` entries, which aborts LVS as "extracted
    # netlist untrustworthy". The obvious suspect was this carve: it deletes
    # obstruction, so the router can route where the macro really has metal.
    # MEASURED with the carve fully OFF: 3,719 entries against 3,716 with it
    # on. The carve is not the cause, and the default stays where round 12
    # put it rather than moving on a refuted story.
    #
    # What the same arm DID establish: routing no longer needs the carve.
    # `pnr` PASSes with an uncarved abstract, because the generator now paints
    # a real 2.0 x 1.5 um port pad and Magic's own `lef write` leaves that pin
    # exposed by itself (measured uncarved: pin 1.2 x 0.7 um, OBS flush on
    # three sides and 0.21 um clear on the fourth). So a caller may set the
    # clearance to 0 and keep a whole, more faithful obstruction — the two
    # arms are simply not yet separable on the sign-off DRC number, because
    # the runner streamed one of them with magic and the other with klayout.
