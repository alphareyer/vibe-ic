"""phase1_one_shot_runner.py — Phase 1 unified dispatcher.

Phase 1 produces structured L1-L23 JSON from one of two input modes:

  - input_doc : vendor docs under `input/docs/` or `phase1/input_doc/`,
                processed by the 17-skill doc-extraction track that
                lives in `phase1_doc_one_shot_runner.py`.
  - input_prompt : free-text prompt under `input/phase1_prompt.md` or
                structured YAML under `input/phase1_structured.yaml`,
                processed by `tools/phase1_engine/cli.py run-all`
                (IC Expert Agent dialogue path, plain-language register).

Both modes write to `phase1/generated_docs/L*.json` + `phase1/human_docs/L*.md`.

The runner auto-detects the mode by probing for input files, and dispatches
to the appropriate backend. Callers may force the mode via `--mode`.

ONE FRONT DOOR (#2052): `--mode prompt` is a request, not an override. When the
detector says the staged input belongs to the doc-extraction track, the request
is resolved to `docs` and announced — the `phase1_engine` reverse-extractor is
not a second entry for raw design input. See `_resolve_mode`.

Outputs:
  - <project>/phase1/generated_docs/L1..L13.json
  - <project>/phase1/human_docs/L*.md
  - <project>/reports/phase1_one_shot.json

chip-AGNOSTIC. Detection logic uses path existence only; no chip-specific
strings.

    WHAT THIS CHANGES, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT
    ---------------------------------------------------
    ``--mode prompt`` used to be an ENTRY into ``phase1_engine``'s
    ``_stub_l_docs_from_prose`` for ANY staged input, including raw design
    prose that ``_detect_input_mode`` had already ruled belongs to the
    doc-extraction track. Measured on one 409-byte ``input/phase1_prompt.md``
    (8HD-6, v1.17.80): the AUTO/docs door published 28 L documents, 4 ports
    and a sufficient verdict at rc 0, while ``--mode prompt`` over the SAME
    bytes published 13 L documents, 0 ports, an EXTRACTION GAP and rc 1. One
    input, two doors, two different designs — and the flow says there is one
    canonical front door.

    So a REQUEST for the prompt backend no longer overrides the detector when
    the detector says the input belongs to the docs track: the prompt is staged
    exactly as AUTO stages it and goes through the docs door, so every layer has
    ONE derivation. ``phase1_engine`` remains reachable, and remains a LIBRARY
    the docs door itself calls (v1.17.74's shared port extractor, v1.17.80's
    shared top-module derivation) — what it stops being is a second front door
    for raw design input.

    AUTO IS UNCHANGED BY CONSTRUCTION: the ``auto`` branch below is the
    pre-existing expression, untouched. The engine still runs exactly where the
    DETECTOR itself answers "prompt" (an ``input/docs/`` that already holds
    pre-structured ``L*.json`` — the reverse-extractor's actual job) and where
    nothing is staged at all (the SKIP that reports "nothing to do").

    Pure: takes two strings, reads no filesystem, returns two. chip-AGNOSTIC.

# ── Step 0.5ic — the route declaration (both input modes) ──────────
#
# WHY THIS IS WIRED, AND WHAT WIRING IT DOES NOT BUY.
#
# Step 0.5ic declares two programs and, until this branch, NOTHING in the
# shipped tree could execute either of them. Measured, not argued:
# `test_matrix_d1_wiring.ORPHAN_DECLARED_PROGRAMS` pinned both as reachable
# through none of the three channels, and
# `test_path_step_matrix_ic_and_ip` carried a strict xfail saying a step whose
# producer nothing dispatches "reports MISSING for every design forever, and
# every reader charges that to the design". That is exactly what happened: a
# real run reported 0.5ic MISSING / declared-artefact-absent, and 36 further
# steps inherited it as `derived-from-upstream`. One step nobody could run
# voided a whole flow.
#
# WIRED HERE rather than in `phase1_doc_one_shot_runner` for the reason the
# expert track above gives: this dispatcher is the one entry point that covers
# BOTH input modes, and `flow_gate_enforcement_audit` inspects THIS file.
#
# RUN BEFORE THE MODE BRANCH, and unconditionally. Step 0.5ic's `blocks_on` is
# empty and it takes no input from D1 — which delivery route a design is on is
# a property of the DESIGN, not of its documents — so gating it behind a D1
# that refused would leave the route unstated for exactly the runs that most
# need to say so.
#
# NOTHING IS INFERRED, AND THAT IS THE POINT. The two producers are handed the
# design's own staged answers and nothing else. A design that staged none gets
# a template searched-for-and-absent with NO reason stated and an entirely
# NOT_DETERMINED declaration; step 0.5ic's own gate then FAILS it with
# NO_TEMPLATE_WITHOUT_REASON, naming what the design did not say. Wiring the
# producers makes the step RUN. It cannot make it PASS, and it must not: a
# route this runner picked on a design's behalf would be a default wearing a
# declaration's clothes.

#: #505's COVERAGE-ONLY SIDECAR, AND WHO IS ENTITLED TO NAME IT. R-0915-160, third cut.
#:
#: The sidecar says a phase-1 failure was PURELY doc-coverage, which is what lets the front door
#: demote instead of halting. It is therefore an EXEMPTION, and an exemption must belong to the
#: pass that earned it.
#:
#: MY SECOND CUT ORDERED THE SIDECAR AGAINST THE RECORD, AND THAT ORDER IS ALWAYS WRONG.
#: `run_second_pass_only` named the sidecar only when `sidecar.mtime >= record.mtime`, reasoning
#: that a sidecar older than its own pass-1 record describes a still earlier run. But pass 1 writes
#: the sidecar FIRST -- `phase1_doc_one_shot_runner` emits it in-process, from inside D1 -- and its
#: record LAST, after the expert track and the steps view. So on every real re-invocation the
#: sidecar IS older than the record, the name was never carried, and the front door read "NOT
#: demoting": a `--skip-phase3` coverage-only project that was PASS_WITH_WAIVERS flipped to FAIL
#: and halted at phase 1. The tests did not catch it because the fixture back-dated the sidecar to
#: `record + 10s`, the reverse of the real order, and the front-door arm only grepped source text.
#:
#: SO NOTHING IS ORDERED BY MTIME HERE ANY MORE. PASS ONE NAMES ITS OWN SIDECAR, and the
#: entitlement is structural instead of temporal:
#:
#:   * pass 1 FORGETS any earlier sidecar before it starts, so a file present when it writes its
#:     record is one D1 wrote in THIS pass -- whatever the clock says, and whichever mode ran;
#:   * pass 1 stamps that file's sha256 into the record it publishes;
#:   * the second pass CARRIES the name forward with the record and computes nothing;
#:   * the front door demotes only when the carried name matches the bytes on disk.
#:
#: A sidecar the carried record does not name stays refused, which is the half that keeps this from
#: laundering a stale file -- the same guarantee the mtime rule was reaching for, from the one
#: direction that is not guaranteed backwards.
#: THE PATH ITSELF LIVES IN `_path_layout` NOW (next/icslot-sidecarpath). This module used to
#: spell it, and `vibe_ic_one_shot_runner` spelled it twice more, and the producer twice more
#: again -- five copies of one exemption's location. Retired rather than re-exported: an alias
#: here would be a second NAME for one path, which is the defect being closed.
