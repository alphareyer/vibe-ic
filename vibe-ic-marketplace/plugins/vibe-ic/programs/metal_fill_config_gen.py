"""metal_fill_config_gen.py — derive a per-layer density metal-fill config from a PDK's
OWN declared files (streamout layermap + tech LEF + sign-off DRC deck).

WHAT GAP THIS CLOSES
--------------------
`metal_fill_emit` / `_density_metal_fill` only run when a PDK bridge declares a
`metal_fill_density` config with per-layer numbers. Every OPEN PDK (gf180mcuD, sky130A,
ihp-sg13g2, …) ships NO such bridge config, so the flow skipped metal fill entirely and
a sparse die FAILed the foundry min-metal-density sign-off DRC (e.g. gf180 M1.4..M5.4 /
MT.3: "Metal_n coverage over the entire die shall be >30%"). This builder synthesizes
the config from data the PDK ALREADY declares, so metal fill runs for any PDK — with
ZERO vendor/chip literal in the logic (chip-AGNOSTIC): every number is READ from the
PDK's own layermap / tech LEF / DRC deck.

DERIVATION (all from PDK-declared text)
---------------------------------------
  * GDS layer numbers  <- the streamout LEF->GDS layermap (`Metal1 <purpose> 34 0`),
    the SAME map the streamout uses, so the fill lands on the exact numbers the deck
    measures.
  * min width / space  <- the tech LEF routing-layer WIDTH / (max) SPACING.
  * dummy datatype     <- the DRC deck's own layer table entry named like
    `<metal>_dummy` / `<metal>_fill` on the SAME drawn number. Foundry density =
    drawn UNION dummy datatype, while LVS `connect` uses drawn only, so fill on the
    dummy datatype raises density WITHOUT breaking LVS. If the deck declares no dummy
    datatype the fill falls back to the drawn datatype (disclosed).
  * density floor      <- the deck's metal-coverage rule threshold (`… * 100 < 30`),
    else a documented default; the fill target = floor + margin.

    WHY THIS EXISTS (measured defect, chip-AGNOSTIC).
    `_metal_re` matches `^<prefix>(\\d+|top)$`, so the prefix must equal the PDK's
    stem EXACTLY (case-insensitively). There is no literal that works everywhere:

        prefix "metal"  matches Metal1  (gf180mcuD)      -- and NOTHING else
                        does NOT match met1   (sky130A)

    The caller's fallback default was the literal ``"metal"``, so on ANY PDK whose
    routing layers are named ``met<n>`` / ``MET<n>`` the layermap and tech-LEF
    parses both returned {}, ``layers`` came out EMPTY, and the caller treated an
    empty config as "this PDK declares no fill config" and skipped metal fill
    silently. The die then FAILs the foundry min-metal-density rule with no
    diagnostic pointing at a name mismatch. That is a one-word default deciding a
    sign-off outcome for two of the three PDKs the module's own docstring claims
    to serve.

    Deriving the stem removes the guess: take every ``TYPE ROUTING`` layer the
    tech LEF declares, strip a trailing number or ``top``, and return the stem
    that the most routing layers agree on. Nothing is assumed about spelling or
    case, and a PDK that names its layers anything self-consistent works.
    Returns None when the tech LEF declares no usable routing-layer name, so the

    only the weaker one was ever populated: a band of fixed width inset from
    the layout's own bounding box, whose width was read out of the PDK's fill
    script (``space_to_scribe_line``). That works when — and only when — three
    things coincide: the marked structure is flush with the layout edge, the
    fill script's margin happens to equal the marker's own width plus the
    deck's clearance for it, and the structure is actually PRESENT. On
    gf180mcuD all three happen to hold for the seal ring (marker 0..16 um,
    clearance 10 um, fill-script margin 26 um), which is what made the
    coincidence look like a contract.

    None of the three is a contract. This reads the rule instead: every layer
    a separation rule names against metal, with the distance that rule states.
    It is self-gating in the way a band is not — a marker layer the layout does
    not carry is EMPTY, so it keeps out nothing, and a layout with no seal ring
    loses no fill area to a band protecting a ring that is not there.

    Layers that are themselves routing metal are excluded: dummy-to-circuit
    metal spacing is not a keep-out REGION, it is the per-layer
    ``space_to_metal`` this same config already carries, and re-expressing it
    here would subtract every wire on the die from the fillable area.

    Chip- and PDK-AGNOSTIC: no layer number, no distance and no layer name is
    written here. An empty list means the deck states no such rule, which is a
    different thing from a clearance of zero and is disclosed as such by the

    covers the layers the DECK has a density rule for. On the run that
    motivated this the config carried five metals; the deck also states a

    not pretend to. Which is the point: the gap is REPORTED BY NAME, with the
    rule and the identifier the rule names, instead of being invisible.

    The pairing is by NAME, and the two names come from the same PDK: the
    deck's rule says `metal2.area`, and this builder keys its layers off the
