phase23_completion_self_audit_check.py — v0.109 mandatory self-audit gate.

THIS GATE IS THE SOLE PHASE 2+3 ACCEPTANCE SIGNAL.

Any agent claiming "Phase 2+3 complete", "design flow done", "tape-out
ready", "ready for fab", "<half-duplex-tester> PASS so we're done", "tapeout_signoff
PASS so we're done", or any equivalent — MUST run this gate FIRST and
paste its output into FINAL_REPORT.md as evidence.

Why this gate exists:
- Individual gates (tapeout_signoff_check, md905_connect_test,
  BACKLOG-v6/v7 P0 set, lvs_yosys_equiv) are NECESSARY but INSUFFICIENT.
- The v0.108 fresh-agent benchmark on <benchmark> demonstrated that an agent
  can pass every individual gate while only completing 2/34 canonical
  flow steps — because steps 14-32 (PnR canonical artefacts, SPEF,
  post-route STA, IR/EM/antenna/SI, post-layout sim, SPICE correlation,
  post-route timing repair, power, metal fill, tapeout checklist) and step 34
  (FPGA final
  sign-off) were never verified.
- This gate wraps `flow_compliance_check.py --strict` and produces a
  single PASS/FAIL with a clear `non-waived PASS = N/34` metric.

Usage:
  python3 phase23_completion_self_audit_check.py <project_dir> [--json [PATH]]

Exit codes:
  0  Overall PASS — Phase 2+3 may be claimed complete
  1  FAIL — at least one canonical step missing/failing without waiver
  2  IO error / project not found

The output of this gate must appear (verbatim, last 10 lines) in
<project>/FINAL_REPORT.md before any release artefact is shipped.

#: 7a63a037f by driving this gate's own `main()`:
#:
#:   * UNANCHORED and first-match-wins: the audit prints its blocker list AFTER the verdict
#:     line and those rows quote gate output, so a quoted `Overall: …` could be read as the
#:     run's verdict.
#:   * rc IGNORED: handed the audit's reconciliation-canary stdout (a green word beside
#:     "do not quote its counts") with rc 1, this gate exited 0 and printed
#:     "Overall: PASS — every canonical step executed and verified.", never mentioning the
#:     canary. This file calls itself "the ONLY signal that authorises a 'Phase 2+3
#:     complete' claim", so that was the one verdict in the tree that most needed both
#:     channels.
#:   * NO `NOT_MEASURED` ALTERNATIVE: after #2572 the orchestrator publishes that word, and
#:     here it matched nothing, became "UNKNOWN", and printed `[FAIL]` at exit 1. Failing
#:     closed, so never a false pass -- but it labelled "could not measure" as a defect
#:     found, which is the mislabel R-0915-159 removed from `step_final_audit`.
#:
#: The timeout still arrives as TEXT, not as an rc: `_run_compliance` catches
#: `TimeoutExpired` and synthesises `Overall: AUDIT_TIMEOUT` into the output. `_audit_verdict`
#: names that word for exactly that reason.
