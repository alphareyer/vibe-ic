"""l24_signoff_requirements_extract.py — R-0915-38.

WHAT THIS EXTRACTS
==================
L24_SIGNOFF's REQUIREMENTS, from the design's own input documents: which
sign-off checks the input says must be run, what it says they must achieve,
at which corners, and WHERE IT SAYS SO (document + line + the line itself).

WHY REQUIREMENTS AND NOT STATUSES
---------------------------------
L24's field template is `drc_status`, `lvs_status`, `sta_status`,
`ir_drop_status`, `antenna_status`, `tapeout_gates[]`. Those are OUTCOMES,
produced in phase 3. Phase 1 runs before DRC, LVS and STA exist, so a phase-1
extractor that filled them would be publishing a certificate for a check that
has not run — and `l24_signoff_evidence_backed_check` is built precisely to
refuse that: it treats every `*_status` / `status` / `verdict` / `result` key
at any depth as a CLAIM requiring an in-project evidence path plus the value
read back. Filling them here would turn the layer from inert to FAILING.

So nothing this module writes uses those key names. The requirement rows live
in `signoff_requirements`, keyed `check` / `requirement` / `corners` /
`threshold` / `citation`, and the outcome fields stay null for phase 3 to
answer. The two halves then meet in the gate: extracted requirement on one
side, the run's own report on the other.

WHAT IS NEVER INVENTED
----------------------
A check the input does not mention is emitted as a row with
`stated: false, requirement: null` AND the scan that looked for it — the
documents read and the terms searched. An absent requirement is reported as a
searched-and-not-found, never as a silent omission and never as a default.
A check the input DOES mention but for which no requirement word is
recognisable keeps `requirement: null` with `stated: true` and the citation,
so a reader sees the sentence and can judge it; the extractor does not guess
what "DRC" alone was supposed to demand.

CORNERS ARE ATTRIBUTED CONSERVATIVELY. A corner token counts as a check's
corner only when it appears inside that check's own clause. MEASURED on spm, a
line reads "TT corner / 10 ns ... sign-off (DRC/LVS/Antenna 全 clean)" — the
corner is stated BEFORE the checks, and extending the clause backwards to
catch it would drag the PREVIOUS check's requirement word in with it ("LVS
clean、STA met" would make STA `clean`, which is the bug this clause logic
exists to fix). So the corner is not attributed, `all_citations` points a
reader at every line that named the check, and the extractor under-claims
rather than inventing a requirement the input did not state for that check.

chip-AGNOSTIC: no design, PDK, vendor, node or signal name appears here. The
check vocabulary is L24's own — its `extraction_hints` name "DRC / LVS / STA /
antenna / IR-drop status per gate" and "the tapeout gate list" — plus EM and
the tapeout precheck named in the ruling.

# ── R-0915-52: the flow's DECLARED sign-off record for a check ─────────────
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. `l24_signoff_evidence_backed_check` judged a stated
# requirement by scanning every `reports/**/*.json` whose stem or
# `program`/`gate`/`subject`/`check` field carried one of the tokens above,
# and took EACH one's verdict. MEASURED on the r19 subservient run
# (gf180mcuD, 2026-09-15): the input states "STA ... setup + hold >= 0", the
# run's post-route sign-off STA PASSED, and the gate still reported
#
#   the input REQUIRES STA ... and this run measured it as 'fail' in
#   reports/phase3/si_mcf_sta.json, 'fail' in reports/phase3/sta/pre_pnr_summary.json
#
# Neither of those is a sign-off reading of STA. `pre_pnr_summary.json` is
# step 10's PRE-LAYOUT ESTIMATE, which R-0915-28 already rules is superseded
# by a passing post-route sign-off; `si_mcf_sta.json` is step 27's SIGNAL
# INTEGRITY envelope, which answers a different question and now has its own
# check row above. The token was standing in for the record.
#
# WHAT REPLACES IT, AND WHY IT IS DERIVED. A requirement is judged by the
# record the FLOW declares as that check's sign-off: the step whose own name
# says it is the sign-off step, and the `reports/**/*.json` it declares in
# `required_outputs`. Both halves come from
# `flow/phase1_phase2_phase3.yaml` — the flow is the single source of truth
# for which step publishes what, and a hand list here would drift away from it
# the first time a step's outputs changed.
#
# MEASURED on the flow at 800cecb34: six steps name themselves sign-off
# (23, 28, 36, 37.4, 39, M4), and after intersecting their declared reports
# with each check's tokens exactly ONE check resolves to a declared record —
# STA, to step 23's four `reports/phase3/sta/*.json`. Every other check
# (DRC, LVS, antenna, IR_drop, EM, tapeout_precheck, SI) derives none and
# keeps the token scan it has today. The change is therefore scoped to the
# defect by construction, not by a special case.
