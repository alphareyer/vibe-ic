"""_pdk_layer_authority — what a TECHNOLOGY says, read from the PDK volume.

Two questions the tape-out precheck used to answer from a DECLARATION, and one
place that answers both from the process itself (vibe-ic#2058, FP-10 and the
orchestrator's ForbiddenLayers ruling of 2026-09-06):

    layer_table(volume)     the (layer, datatype) pairs the technology's own
                            KLayout layer table defines. The ALLOWED set —
                            everything else in a GDS is a layer the process
                            does not know.
    seal_ring_facility(v)   whether this technology can build a seal ring at
                            all, i.e. whether the volume ships the generator
                            `die_finishing_gen` drives.

WHY A DECLARATION CANNOT ANSWER EITHER
======================================
`seal_ring_required: false` and `forbidden_layers: []` are both a design saying
"do not check this". MEASURED on spm x gf180mcuD (lane czspmfp, image label
0.3.46): `General.SealRing` reported NOT_DETERMINED for a declared `false`
while `die_finishing_gen` treated the SAME false as a decided not-applicable
and wrote its SKIPPED marker — two consumers of one declaration disagreeing
about what it means, and neither able to reach a PASS. `General.ForbiddenLayers`
reported NOT_DETERMINED over 32 layer/datatype pairs because nobody had written
a list down.

A NOT_APPLICABLE is legitimate ONLY when it is a fact about the PROCESS: this
technology has no seal-ring facility, so there is nothing to check and nothing
to declare away. That is derivable, and it is derived here. A DECLARED false is
refused, and says so.

WHAT COUNTS AS THE LAYER TABLE
==============================
The KLayout layer-properties document (`*.lyp`) the technology ships beside its
`.lyt` — the table the deck and the viewer both read. It is XML with one
`<source>layer/datatype@cv</source>` per entry, optionally prefixed by a name
(`LVS_RF 100/5@1`), and it is the same shape in every PDK the pinned image
carries. MEASURED over that image (label 0.3.46), parsing only `<source>`:

    gf180mcuD   118 pairs   libs.tech/klayout/tech/gf180mcu.lyp
    sky130A     429 pairs   libs.tech/klayout/tech/sky130A.lyp
    ihp-sg13g2  378 pairs   libs.tech/klayout/tech/sg13g2.lyp
    asap7         -         no libs.tech/klayout at all
    nangate45     -         no libs.tech/klayout at all

A volume with no readable table returns None. NOT_DETERMINED is the answer
then, naming the authority that was missing — never an empty ALLOWED set, which
would make every layer in every GDS forbidden at once.

RESOLVING THE VOLUME FROM A PDK NAME
====================================
The name a run resolves is not always the volume's directory name: MEASURED on
spm, `tapeout_precheck` published `pdk="gf180mcu"` (read from the run's own tool
logs) while the volume is `gf180mcuD`. Resolution therefore tries, in order,
recording every attempt so an absence names specific paths:

    1. `pdk_registry.json` entry whose `name` matches exactly
    2. ... whose `basename(container_path)` matches exactly
    3. ... whose `name` starts with the asked-for name, UNIQUELY. Two
       candidates is an ambiguity and returns nothing: a confident answer about
       which of two processes was meant is exactly the kind of guess this
       module exists to remove.
    4. `$PDK_ROOT/<name>` — the environment, consulted last and only when the
       registry said nothing, because the environment is a fact about the
       machine and not about the design.

chip-AGNOSTIC: no foundry, vendor, node or SKU literal. Every name here comes
from `pdk_registry.json`, from the caller, or from the environment; the two
relative paths are PDK STRUCTURE (the layout every KLayout-integrated PDK
uses), and the seal-ring one is imported from `die_finishing_gen` rather than
re-spelled so the two cannot drift.

#: THE FLOW'S OWN MARKER LAYERS, derived from the writer, never typed here.
#:
#: `def_gds_port_power_restore` puts port-label text and power-rail markers into
#: the streamed GDS so `klayout_pdk_lvs` can name the power nets geometrically.
#: They are OURS: no PDK layer table defines them, and MEASURED on spm x
#: gf180mcuD they are exactly the three pairs that rung reported as unmapped —
#: 100/0, 901/0 and 902/0 out of 32 in use.
#:
#: THE DATATYPE IS DATA, THE LAYER IS THE CONTRACT. That module's own comment:
#: "text GDS layer TEXT_LAYER[0] (100), datatype = the pin's 1-based metal index
#: (MET1->dt1, MET2->dt2, …) … datatype 0 = catch-all for a pin with no resolved
#: metal layer". So the label datatype depends on how many metals THIS design
#: routed on, and only the LAYER number can be declared ahead of a run. Matching
#: layer 100 at any datatype is therefore the derivation, not a widening — and
#: it is why this returns a layer number beside the exact pairs instead of
#: pretending to enumerate a family it cannot know.
#:
#: IMPORTED, NEVER RE-SPELLED. A typed copy of `(901, 0)` here would be a second
#: declaration of the same fact, free to drift from the writer the day someone
#: moves it — which is the whole shape `_declared_die` exists to remove one
#: layer down.
