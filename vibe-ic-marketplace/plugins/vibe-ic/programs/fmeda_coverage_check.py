"""fmeda_coverage_check.py — independent anti-fabrication gate over the FMEDA
diagnostic-coverage report emitted by `fmeda_fault_injection_coverage.py`.

WHY a separate gate: the producer already self-gates (its exit code reflects DC
vs the ASIL floor), but per the plugin's producer/gate doctrine a report's own
`verdict`/`ge_floor` boolean must NOT be trusted at sign-off. This gate RE-READS
`reports/phase2/safety/fmeda_coverage.json`, RECOMPUTES the verdict from the raw
`detected_faults` / `injected_faults` counts + the ASIL floor, and IGNORES the
written `verdict`/`ge_floor`. A report that claims PASS while its own counts say
DC < floor is caught (recomputed verdict wins), and a report that claims a DC
while `baseline_valid=false` is FAILed (a bogus measurement is not a pass).

  * NOT_APPLICABLE (applicable=false)  → not a verdict. This step only fires
    for designs that DECLARE a safety mechanism; a non-safety design must skip,
    never fail. WHICH kind of skip is mirrored from the producer's own report,
    never re-derived here: when that report carries a valid R-0915-119
    `structural_absence` record — the RTL was read, its modules enumerated and
    none of them is a safety mechanism — this gate states the same
    NOT_APPLICABLE_BY_STRUCTURE with the same enumeration and exits 2 (the
    non-verdict-candidate code). Every other inapplicable shape — an input
    nobody read, a mechanism found with no encoder, a missing report — keeps
    the disclosed VACUOUS PASS at exit 0. Mirroring rather than re-deriving is
    the point: two gates of one step must not hold two opinions about one
    design, and a second scanner is a second answer waiting to disagree with
    the first.
  * applicable=true → recompute DC = detected/injected, compare to the resolved
    ASIL floor, require baseline_valid. Mismatch with the written verdict is
    reported and the RECOMPUTED verdict is authoritative.
  * missing report → this gate is a no-op VACUOUS PASS ONLY IF the design has no
    safety mechanism is UNKNOWN here, so a missing report is a soft skip (exit 0)
    unless --require is passed (then a missing report FAILs).

USAGE
  python3 fmeda_coverage_check.py <project> [--report <path>] [--asil D]
      [--min-dc <pct>] [--require] [--json <out>]

EXIT
  2 — the R-0915-119 decided state, mirrored from the producer's report, or an
      IO / argument error. Both are NON-VERDICT CANDIDATES the consumer
      classifies from the report, never from the number alone.
  0 — recomputed PASS, or a DISCLOSED vacuous/soft skip. A vacuous exit prints
      a LINE-START `VACUOUS_PASS:` token — the rc-0 disclosure channel
      `flow_compliance_check._stdout_signals_vacuous` reads — so the step
      resolves to the VACUOUS_PASS tier instead of the plain PASS bucket.
  1 — recomputed FAIL (DC < floor, invalid baseline, or fabricated verdict)
