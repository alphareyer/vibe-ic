"""formal_harness_gen.py — Step 5 DETERMINISTIC formal-property authoring.

Wires the formal step so a BARE run (no AI) still authors every property that
can be derived safely and records the denominator it could not author. It reads
the design's OWN L3/L6/L8 declarations plus top-module interface and reset logic
(design INPUT only, §4.05) and emits a `formal_<top>.sv` harness
carrying the always-valuable, construction-safe **reset-safety** invariant:

    one cycle after the design's declared reset is asserted, every registered
    output settles to the exact value the RTL's OWN reset branch assigns it.

`formal_property_run.py` then dispatches that harness to SymbiYosys with the
in-container `abc pdr` engine (`aigsmt none` — no external SMT solver needed),
producing a REAL unbounded proof + evidence that `formal_proof_evidence_check`
consumes. This closes the Step-5 "no formal tool ran" SKIP without any AI in
the loop, for any synchronous design with a clock, a reset and a registered
output whose reset value is a literal constant.

Why this is construction-safe (can never fabricate a proof OR a false FAIL):
  * The asserted value is LIFTED VERBATIM from the design's own reset branch —
    it is definitionally the value the FF holds after reset, so a correct
    design PROVES it and never counter-examples it.
  * When the interface / reset value cannot be determined with confidence the
    generator emits no assertion and returns INCOMPLETE, naming the missing
    declaration/property and the `formal-verify` expert route. It returns
    NOT_APPLICABLE only when the design explicitly declares formal inapplicable.

chip-AGNOSTIC: the mechanism keys off GENERIC hardware conventions (a clock /
reset port, a registered output) and the design's own RTL text. There is no
vendor / SKU / IC / PDK literal anywhere — the per-design names and reset values
come from the RTL, which is design INPUT.

# ── #2183 — THREE INPUT STATES THAT USED TO PRINT THE SAME SENTENCE ─────────
#
# `declaration_obligations` reported one thing — "<L> declaration is absent;
# applicability and property are unknown" — for three states that are not the
# same statement about the design:
#
#   1. the Phase-1 declaration ROOT does not exist at all, so nothing was read;
#   2. the root exists and holds an `L*.json` that could NOT be parsed or
#      opened (`json.loads` / `read_text` raised, and the exception was
#      swallowed by a bare `continue`);
#   3. the root exists but could not be LISTED — `Path.glob` answers a
#      directory it may not read with an empty iterator and no exception, so
#      every declaration inside it, individually openable by name, was counted
#      as a layer the design never declared. Its sibling, an ancestor that
#      cannot be traversed, was not silent but was not Step 5's answer either:
#      `Path.is_dir()` propagates EACCES, so the exception escaped this
#      function and the runner's blanket handler wrote one opaque
#      `authoring_program_error` row naming no root and no layer;
#   4. the root exists, every file in it was read, and the design genuinely
#      declares nothing for that layer.
#
# Only (4) is "absent". (1), (2) and (3) are "I could not read it", and
# reporting them as (4) is what left vibe-ic#2183 unable to name its own
# mechanism: the run's own `property_contract.json` said the design's L3/L6/L8
# declarations were absent while they were present and yielded four
# obligations, and the artefact carried nothing that could say WHICH root had
# been read. Every contract below now names that root, so the next reader of a
# phantom denominator can see the directory it was measured against.
#
# (3) is the state this file reproduced LAST, and it is the one that still
# printed (4)'s sentence after (1) and (2) were separated out. MEASURED
# (lane cy2183, 8HD-4, 2026-09-09) on `main` 610cae2cc2b9, against a project
# whose L3/L6/L8 are present and whose declaration root is merely not
# listable:

#         "L3 declaration is absent; applicability and property are unknown"
#
# — which is #2183's reported artefact, verbatim, produced from a root whose
# declarations are on disk and readable BY NAME. A directory this process may
# not list is not a design that declared nothing.
#
# Never greener: each state is still an UNRESOLVED row on an INCOMPLETE
# verdict, the denominator is unchanged, and an unreadable file or root adds a
# row where it used to add silence.

# ── R-0915-144 — observable DUT state and the generated L8 reset properties ─
#
# WHY OBSERVERS, AND WHY NEVER `dut.<reg>`. MEASURED 2026-09-23 (lane icspm5
# §48, mechanism confirmed by lane icformal1): a property written over a
# hierarchical reference into the DUT does NOT read the DUT's register in this
# flow's formal path. yosys `read_verilog` has no hierarchical references; it
# makes `dut.pr` an IMPLICITLY DECLARED LOCAL WIRE of the harness
#     Warning: Identifier `\dut.pr' is implicitly declared.
#     Warning: Wire formal_spm.\dut.pr is used but has no driver.
# which the engine then treats as a FREE variable. The same claim over the
# harness port `p` (`assign p = pr`) proved while the one over `dut.pr` failed
# at frame 3. (Under the harness's own `default_nettype none` it is a hard
# parse error instead.) Either way the property is not about the design.
#
# The mechanism the engine DOES bind is the flow's own `@connect` one (see
# `formal_property_run.emit_invariant_sby`): the harness declares an explicit,
# undriven `(* keep *)` observer wire, and the .sby script flattens the design
# and `connect -set`s the observer to the flattened DUT net, after asserting
# that net exists. Measured on spm: s/c/yr/pr all prove zero one cycle after
# reset, and a mutant whose reset branch leaves `yr` alone fails. The pragma is
# `@observe`, not `@connect`, so a generated harness stays on the STANDARD proof

    # It had nowhere for them to LIVE. The only file carrying properties is
    # this harness, and the write below is an unconditional

    Returns (iface, dut_file, analysis, descended?, basis) or None.

    THE SEARCH USED TO BE ONE PATH WHILE ITS ANSWER CLAIMED THE WHOLE DESIGN.
    ============================================================================
    The descent gives up the moment a module instantiates anything other than
    exactly one child, and `generate` then reports "no module with a
    construction-safe reset-safety property" — a statement about every module
    there is, derived from having examined a single chain of them.

    MEASURED (subservient x sky130A). `subservient` instantiates TWO children,
    `subservient_core` and `subservient_gpio`, so the walk broke at the top and
    the step reported NOT_APPLICABLE. Pointing the SAME program at
    `subservient_gpio` — same project, same RTL — emitted a complete harness
    with two construction-safe properties (`o_rdata == '0` and `o_gpio == '0`
    one cycle after reset, sync reset). The capability was there the whole time;
    only the walk could not reach it. Step 5 then failed, and steps 7, 8, 10 and
    11 went MISSING as blocked-by-upstream — one unreachable branch costing five
    canonical steps, on every hierarchical design whose top-level outputs are
    driven from more than one sub-module, which is essentially every SoC.

    So when the single-child descent ends empty, the hierarchy BELOW the
    declared top is scanned. Not the file set: a module nobody instantiates is
    not part of this design. The basis is returned and recorded, because a
    property proven on a sub-module is a WEAKER statement than one proven on the
    top, and a reader who cannot tell the two apart has been handed the same
    kind of answer this fix removes."""
