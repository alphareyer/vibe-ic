"""Steps 31, 37.3, 37.4 and the 36 / 37.5ic feeds on LibreLane (lane mig105).

Physical verification, the finishing XOR and the sign-off metrics record,
measured by LibreLane's own steps on the stream the run ships:

* **31** ``Magic.DRC`` + ``KLayout.DRC`` (+ ``KLayout.Density``) on the GDS, and
  ``Magic.SpiceExtraction`` -> ``Netgen.LVS`` on the routed DEF, all from ONE
  bridged State (``state_from_direct``, which writes the powered netlist from
  the DEF's own database as LibreLane's OpenROAD steps do).
* **37.3** ``Vibeic.FinishingXOR`` (plugin step): finishing never removes,
  covers or overlaps design geometry.  LibreLane's own ``KLayout.XOR`` (the
  Magic vs KLayout stream) stays the stream-fidelity half.
* **37.5ic** ``Vibeic.DatabaseUnit`` (plugin step): the stream's UNITS is the
  declared grid.
* **37.4** ``state_metrics`` turns the chains' State metrics into the rows of
  ``phase3/final/metrics.json``, each bound to the ``state_out.json`` that
  measured it by sha256.

THE ONE RULE (``judge_pv``): a metric counts only when the step that
produces it wrote it, in THIS chain -- present in that step's ``state_out.json``
and absent from its ``state_in.json``.  A producer that ran and wrote nothing,
a metric carried in from an earlier state, and a step that did not run are all
``NOT_MEASURED``, never 0.  LibreLane's ``MetricChecker`` only warns in those
cases and ``ReportManufacturability`` prints ``Passed`` beside an N/A engine;
the fork fix is vibeic/librelane#16, not in the 0.3.79 image, so the host
applies the rule itself.  For verification "better" is not the lower count:
both DRC engines must be clean, and one clean beside one dirty is recorded as
``LL_DRC_ENGINES_DISAGREE`` (a finding, never a pick).
