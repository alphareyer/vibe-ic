"""verilator_coverage_measure.py — v0.53 plugin gate

Force machine-measured Verilator coverage instead of agent-estimated numbers.

The v0.52 fresh-agent <half-duplex-tester> PASS was accompanied by a self-reported
"≥ 95 % estimated line coverage". When actually measured with
`verilator --coverage --coverage-line --coverage-toggle`, line coverage
was 78.3 %, toggle 75.5 %, branch 82.3 %. This gate rejects reports that
lack tool-generated coverage artefacts.

Three modes:
  measure    — run Verilator + compile + simulate a C++ driver + parse
               coverage.dat
  measure-tb — INSTRUMENT AND RUN THE PROJECT'S OWN VERILOG TESTBENCH.
               `verilator --binary --timing --coverage --coverage-line
               --coverage-toggle` builds a standalone simulation from the
               same TB the flow simulated, executes it, and the real
               line/toggle/branch points are read out of the coverage.dat
               that run produced. No C++ driver needed, so this is the mode
               a flow can actually wire.
  check      — only verify that a prior run produced coverage.dat +
               a coverage JSON with tool-generated content

ONE PRODUCER PER PATH
=====================
`reports/phase2/coverage/coverage_actual.json` used to be written by TWO
producers: `design_one_shot_runner`, which writes a FUNCTIONAL-verification
verdict payload there (verdict / evidence / verification_track /
scenarios_covered, NO `totals` container), and this program's `measure`,
which writes the line/toggle/branch measurement. A path with two producers
cannot be read: on every real run the functional payload landed there first
and `check` correctly reported that line/toggle/branch was never measured.

The two are now SEPARATE artefacts:

  reports/phase2/coverage/coverage_actual.json     functional verdict
                                                   (design_one_shot_runner)
  reports/phase2/coverage/coverage_verilator.json  the measurement
                                                   (this program)

`COVERAGE_MEASUREMENT_REL` below is the single name for the measurement
path; the Step-4 gate, `coverage_closure` and `fpga_verification_audit`
all read it. Nothing about the checker's standard changed — it still
refuses anything that is not a real tool-generated measurement.

ONE NAMESPACE PER DOCUMENT (#2180)
==================================
This report is composed on the host, stored on the host and read on the host,
so every path in it is a HOST path. Most of them are that by construction:
`coverage_dat`, `testbench` and `rtl_sources` are composed here from inputs
this program was handed.

`per_file`'s keys — and therefore `scope_files`, which is derived from them —
are the ONLY values that come from somewhere else: they are the source files
VERILATOR named, in the namespace Verilator ran in. When the flow dispatches
the instrumented build into the pinned image, that namespace is the
CONTAINER's, and writing it verbatim produced one document carrying two
namespaces with nothing in it saying which field was which:

    rtl_sources  ["<project>/phase2/stage1/rtl/<top>.v"]              host
    scope_files  ["/foss/designs/<project>/phase2/stage1/rtl/<top>.v"] container

Same bytes, two spellings, three keys apart. `_cov_project_root` below reads
both keys to locate the project, and `project_outputs_in_tree_check` blocks on
the container half — correctly, because on the machine the report is read on
that file does not exist.

So tool-reported paths are normalised at INGEST, in `parse_coverage_dat`,
before anything persists them, using the container's own mount table through
`_designs_root.host_spelling` — the module that already owns the forward
translation, so there is no second answer to a question the repo has answered
once. `path_namespace` in the payload states what happened, including the two
cases that are NOT a translation: a path with no host spelling at all (an
image-internal source, a PDK cell) is left in the tool's namespace and NAMED,
and a run that declared no container is recorded as not examined rather than
as a document full of host paths.

SCOPE — the DESIGN, not the testbench
=====================================
A testbench is driven top to bottom by construction, so folding its points
into the totals only dilutes them upward. `measure-tb` totals the points of
the RTL SOURCES ONLY (`--scope-file`, defaulted to the DUT sources handed to
Verilator) and records the per-file breakdown for everything, testbench
included, so the exclusion is visible rather than assumed.

Usage:
    # Measure from scratch (assumes RTL under ./rtl and main driver under
    # sim/cov_build/main.cpp — see your project's conventions)
    python3 verilator_coverage_measure.py measure \\
        --rtl-dir rtl \\
        --top example_top \\
        --main sim/cov_build/main.cpp \\
        --out reports/coverage/coverage_actual.json

    # Measure by instrumenting the project's OWN Verilog testbench
    python3 verilator_coverage_measure.py measure-tb \\
        --project . \\
        --out reports/phase2/coverage/coverage_verilator.json

    # Check-only mode (no rebuild, verify stored artefact)
    python3 verilator_coverage_measure.py check \\
        --coverage-json reports/phase2/coverage/coverage_verilator.json \\
        --min-line 70 --min-toggle 60 --min-branch 70

Exit code (`measure`):
    0 — all thresholds met
    1 — threshold(s) below target

Exit code (`check`) — COVERAGE-CREDIT SPLIT of the two meanings that used to
share exit 2. `flow_compliance_check._check_program_exit_zero` maps rc=2 onto
VACUOUS_PASS ("the input this gate audits does not apply to this project"),
and VACUOUS_PASS was counted into `pass_count`. So every rc=2 this program
returned bought the enclosing step PASS credit — including for an artefact
that EXISTS at the declared coverage path but carries no coverage in it.
An artefact under the coverage path with no `totals.*` is a MISLABELLED
artefact, not an inapplicable input.
(State AS MEASURED THEN. `flow_compliance_check` has since dropped
VACUOUS_PASS from the executed-PASS numerator — the tier leaves X and stays
in Y — so an rc=2 no longer buys PASS credit. The split below is unaffected:
a mislabelled artefact must be rc=1 whatever the tier above it counts, and
this program's own rc=2 was the mechanism by which step 4 was measured
VACUOUS_PASS on the host that found the numerator defect.)

    0 — a real measurement is present and every threshold is met
    1 — a DEFECT: below threshold, OR the artefact at the declared path is
        corrupt / mislabelled / forged, OR no measurement exists on a host
        where the Verilator toolchain that would have taken it IS installed
    3 — a DISCLOSED capability gap (printed with the `PASS_WITH_WAIVERS`
        stdout sentinel `_check_program_exit_zero` requires): no coverage
        measurement AND no Verilator on PATH to have taken one. The step
        resolves to WAIVED-DEFERRED — reviewable, review_required, and
        REMOVED from the executed-PASS numerator — instead of silently
        counting as a pass.

    rc=2 is no longer emitted by `check`. Other programs that legitimately
    use the input-missing convention (foundry_handoff_package_check,
    mixed_signal_merge_check) are untouched: the semantics change is local
    to this program, not to `_check_program_exit_zero`.

Generality: works for any Verilator-compatible RTL. Threshold defaults are
conservative; tighten per project maturity.

#: THE TOOL ALREADY MERGES LINES ACROSS INSTANCE PATHS; ONLY `--write` DOES
#: NOT. MEASURED in the released image (verilator_coverage 5.053, two TBs that
#: instantiate the same module as `tbA.u_dut` and `tbB.dut_i`):
#: `--write merged.dat` keeps 58 `C` records, twice the 29 of one run, while
#: `--write-info merged.info` writes ONE `DA:<line>,<hits>` per source line of
#: the shared module, keyed by file and line only. So the line-level suite
#: union has a second, independent producer: the tool. Toggle and branch
#: points stay per instance in lcov (`BRDA` rows repeat), so those keep the
#: `h`-stripping union above. The lcov `DA` row is per SOURCE LINE and carries
#: every point type on that line (a port's toggle points sit on the module
#: header line), so the two are compared as the same question: which lines of
#: which file carry a point, and which of them any run hit.

#
# That testbench is an 87-line generated skeleton whose OWN header says "It is
# CONNECTIVITY-ONLY (it closes no functional coverage on its own)".  It declares
# `cs`, `we`, `address`, `write_data`, wires them to the DUT, initialises them
# at declaration and NEVER assigns them again: the only signals it drives are
# the clock and the reset.  16.48% is the coverage of releasing reset and
# waiting — it is not a property of the RTL.  The same run held a cocotb
# testbench that had just driven 1020 NIST vectors through the whole design.
#
# "I did not measure the design" and "I measured the design at 16.48%" are two
# different facts, and reporting the second when the first is true sends the
# reader to the RTL for a defect that is in the coverage build.  This audit
# separates them.  It NEVER makes the verdict pass: a run with no functional
# stimulus still blocks, because unmeasured is not verified.
#
# THE CRITERION IS THE TESTBENCH'S OWN BEHAVIOUR, not its name.  A population
# defined by one spelling of a filename is blind to every other spelling, so
# nothing here matches `*_full.v` or any other path shape.  What is counted is
# a fact anyone can re-derive from the file: of the signals this testbench
# binds to the DUT's ports and declares as drivable (`reg`), how many does it
# ever assign outside their declaration, excluding the clock and the reset?
# Zero means the design's inputs were never moved.  The header self-description
# is reported as corroboration and decides nothing, precisely because a comment
# can be deleted while the testbench stays inert.

            # all five lines to stderr, and the sentence it exists to say
            # never reached the step record.  MEASURED, sha256 x sky130A on
            # v1.16.41: stdout 0 bytes, stderr 859 bytes;
            # `flow_compliance_check.output_snippet` keeps
            # `_head_and_tail(stdout)` but only `_grown_tail(stderr, 300)` —
            # a deliberate asymmetry its own docstring explains, because
            # stderr is the CRASH channel and a crash's evidence is its tail.
            # So the headline, being FIRST, was cut before the caller's
            # `out[:200]` ever ran, and the step record showed line 4:
            #
            #   output: [check] this run HAS a functional testbench that was
            #           not instrumented: ...

            # Widening that 200 does NOT fix it: the sentence is not in the
            # 344-byte snippet at all.  Nor is the fix to change the stderr
            # window — that window is load-bearing for crash detection and is
            # pinned by `test_crash_is_flagged_as_a_crash_at_any_checkout_depth`.
            #
            # The defect is a CHANNEL one, and it is mine: a gate's verdict is
            # stdout, and stderr is where a crash lands.  Writing a structured
            # verdict into the crash channel got it treated as crash tail.
            # Moving it back is not betting on which line a consumer picks —
            # `_head_and_tail` keeping the head is that function's stated
            # contract, not an accident of position.
