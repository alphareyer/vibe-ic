l24_signoff_evidence_backed_check.py — batch-8 / layergate-8 (L24_SIGNOFF)

WHAT THIS GATE ENFORCES
=======================
L24_SIGNOFF models per-gate sign-off status (drc / lvs / sta / antenna /
ir_drop) plus a tapeout-gate checklist.

The consumer contract, stated honestly:

    L24 HAS NO CONSUMER TODAY. The statuses it models are produced by phase-3
    programs (signoff_ladder_run.py, tapeout_checklist, dft_signoff_check.py)
    which write their OWN reports and never read — or write back to — L24.
    In 24/24 sampled real Phase-1 runs the layer is 100% inert:
    extraction_status=NOT_YET_EXTRACTED, every status null, tapeout_gates [].

So this gate does NOT demand that L24 be filled in. Demanding content for a
layer nobody reads would be exactly the "token appears somewhere" mistake in
reverse: manufacturing work that no consumer needs.

What it enforces is the HAZARD that arrives the instant a consumer IS added:

    A Phase-1-asserted drc_status='PASS' with no evidence path is the
    false-certificate shape. It is the same failure family as the defect that
    motivated this batch — a completeness check that said CAPTURED because a
    token appeared in some layer, while the layer the backend actually
    consumed had it 0 times, and the whole detailed route aborted five steps
    downstream behind an opaque router error.

THE RULE
--------
    A sign-off status is complete when it is DERIVED from an evidence path —
    a report file that exists inside this project, plus the value that was
    read out of it — never when it is an asserted string.

Concretely, for every verdict L24 asserts:
  (1) it must be bound to an evidence record naming a PATH,
  (2) that path must resolve to a file INSIDE the project (evidence outside
      the run is not reproducible evidence),
  (3) the record must name the VALUE that was read back ("I looked at the
      report" is not evidence of WHAT was read), and
  (4) that value must still be findable in that file.

Claims are discovered from the layer's OWN key names (any ``*_status`` /
``status`` / ``verdict`` / ``result`` key, at any depth, including inside
``tapeout_gates[]``). Nothing about any design, PDK, vendor or signal is
hardcoded — this gate has never seen the design it is checking.

Only the ABSENCE of information is enumerated (null, TBD, PENDING,
NOT_YET_EXTRACTED, ...). Everything else counts as a CLAIM. That direction is
deliberate: a whitelist of positive verdicts would let a novel verdict word
through silently, which is the exact class of hole this gate exists to close.

BLOCKS OR ADVISES?
------------------
**BLOCKS** (exit 1 is a hard FAIL; it is NOT listed in
flow_compliance_check.INFORMATIONAL_GATES).

Why blocking is the right call even though L24 has no consumer:
  * The gate can only fire when the layer ASSERTS a sign-off verdict. On the
    inert layer every real run emits today, it exits 2 (SKIP) and costs
    nothing — 24/24 sampled runs SKIP, zero false positives.
  * The only way to make it fail is to publish an unevidenced certificate.
    There is no legitimate reason for Phase 1 — which runs before DRC, LVS
    and STA exist — to certify their outcome. A gate that merely *advised*
    here would repeat compounding failure (b) from the motivating defect: the
    verdict was FAIL and the flow continued anyway.
  * It forecloses the hazard the day a consumer is wired in, instead of
    discovering it five steps downstream like last time.

NO WAIVER (governance-hard). A waiver here would read "let me certify
sign-off without evidence", which is the thing being prevented.

Usage:
    python3 l24_signoff_evidence_backed_check.py <project_dir>

Exit codes:
    0 = PASS  — every asserted verdict traces to a verified evidence read-back
    1 = FAIL  — at least one verdict is asserted without verifiable evidence
    2 = SKIP  — no L24 present, L24 is an N/A stub, or the layer asserts
                nothing (today's real-run state)

# ── R-0915-52: the gate STATES its own reason class ───────────────────────
#
# The completion audit's `classify_sub_gate` says of a FAIL record: "the
# record carries a FAIL verdict and no field that separates a measurement
# from a failure to read its input". That is true of this gate today, and it
# is the reason a real finding and an unreadable project look identical to a
# reader of the record.
#
# The field that separates them is `reason_class`, from the repo's own closed
# vocabulary in `_flow_reason_taxonomy`. It is written ONLY when this gate
# produced no measurement of the design, and is `null` on every verdict that
# IS one — including a FAIL, because a requirement measured and found unmet is
# a measurement, not a reason to excuse the step. A class on a measured verdict
# would be the false-disclosure shape in the other direction.
