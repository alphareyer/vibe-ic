"""librelane_import.py — import a LibreLane run into the canonical tree (llv1 W6).

Under ``--librelane`` the layout is LibreLane's. vibe-ic's gates still read the
canonical tree (``phase2/stage2/synth``, ``phase3/stage3/pnr``, ...), so every
file a gate reads must arrive there from the run that produced it, bound to it
by sha256, with a provenance row that says who produced it (W19).

WHAT IT KEYS ON
---------------
The run's OWN records, never folder ordinals:
  * ``flow.log`` lists every step LibreLane started, in order, by instance id
    (``_tool_log_provenance.flow_log_steps``, a calibrated reader);
  * each folder's ``config.json`` names the step class that wrote it; the two
    must agree (an instance id is the class id, or the class id plus ``-N``).
A rule names a step CLASS and takes its one TOP-LEVEL run: a run nested inside
a composite step (``Odb.DiodesOnPorts`` re-running ``DetailedPlacement``) is
never the stage's database. A rule that names an anchor (``after``) takes the
top-level run that follows the anchor's run. More than one candidate is
refused by name, never chosen by position. The chosen step must have written
its ``state_out.json`` (LibreLane writes it only after the step's ``run()``).

A RUN IMPORTS ONLY WHEN IT FINISHED
-----------------------------------
LibreLane writes ``Flow complete.`` to flow.log only after every step it was
asked to run returned (``--to`` included) and no deferred error is left; its
failure message is printed after flow.log is closed, so a failed run simply
stops. ``flow_status`` (a calibrated reader) reads the LAST invocation (from
its ``Starting…`` line). Without ``Flow complete.`` after its last started step
the import refuses (``LL_IMPORT_FLOW_INCOMPLETE``, naming that step, its folder
and its transcripts): an aborted run is an honest FAIL with the tool's own
log, never a partial import whose missing steps read as "not performed". A
segment declared with ``to`` must also end at that step, finished.

SEGMENTS
--------
The two-segment plan (W5) is ONE call: ``import_segments(project,
[(seg1_run_dir, "Checker.NetlistAssignStatements"), (seg2_run_dir, None)])``
(CLI: ``librelane_import.py <project> <seg1>=Checker.NetlistAssignStatements
<seg2>``). Each rule is taken from the one segment that ran it (two segments
running it is refused). Consecutive segments must meet at adjacent top-level
flow-loop slots; a step skipped by both is a segment gap, not a flow step the
tool does not perform. ``not_performed`` is computed only after that check.

WHAT IT WRITES
--------------
* The canonical files, COPIED (never symlinked; a symlink at a destination is
  replaced, not written through). State views go through
  ``librelane_contract.handoff_to_direct`` with a ``path_map`` from the path the
  run recorded to where the run now lives; a view recorded by an EARLIER step
  is refused, since the row would attribute it to the wrong step.
* One provenance row per imported step: a witnessed row
  (``_tool_log_provenance.witnessed_row``, decision 4a) when the step's own
  tool logs support one, else a #365 back-fill (``reconstructed: true``). Each
  row gets the artefact-derived measurement ``_runner_measurement`` states.
* ``phase3/stage3/pnr/openroad.log`` assembled from the OpenROAD step logs in
  flow order. Every inserted section is bracketed by a marker naming its source
  log and sha256; the assembled file is itself a back-fill row.
* W0's import manifest (``reports/phase3/impl/import_manifest.json``,
  schema ``vibe-ic/external-flow-import/2``), written ONLY through
  ``_external_flow_manifest.write_manifest``, which validates every row
  against the disk. One run is written flat (``run_dir``, ``rows``,
  ``flow_status``); two segment runs as ``segments: [{name, run_dir,
  flow_status, rows}]`` (W0's segment extension, see that module). Rows are
  in W0's final field names (flow step, canonical path, tool-run path,
  sha256 on both sides, tool, tool step id, step_dir, the source logs the
  step's witness cites, exit code, measurement), run-relative to their
  segment's ``run_dir`` (itself project-relative). Also ``not_performed``
  (every rule no segment performed), and, as importer fields, ``top``,
  ``removed`` (files an earlier import of the same runs wrote that this one
  does not) and ``openroad_log``.

ALL OR NOTHING
--------------
Every rule is planned, and every refusal raised, BEFORE anything is written.
The writes then run under a journal: if one still fails, every path is
restored. A project whose manifest records an import of OTHER runs is refused
(a different run needs a fresh project); re-importing the same runs removes
the canonical files the earlier import wrote and this one does not, only while
their bytes still match the previous manifest. Importer records and any run
tree can never be deletion targets.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
-------------------
Reports whose grammar vibe-ic's own consumers were not measured against
(LibreLane's STA summaries, DRC/LVS reports, antenna reports) go under
``reports/phase3/librelane/<flow step>/``, never under a sign-off name: the
kept vibe-ic decks own those (decision 11g). It judges nothing: a step this
flow did not do is listed in ``not_performed`` for the verdict layer (W14).

chip-AGNOSTIC: no design, PDK, corner or cell literal. The top comes from the
run's own ``resolved.json``; corners come from the state, and the nominal SPEF
is the state corner the RCX step's own ``DEFAULT_CORNER`` matches.
