"""Give a container command a deadline the CONTAINER enforces.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
======================
Every EDA tool this flow drives runs inside a container, invoked as

    subprocess.run(["docker", "exec", <container>, "bash", "-lc", cmd],
                   capture_output=True, text=True, timeout=N)

That ``timeout=N`` reads like a deadline on the tool. It is not. It is a
deadline on the LOCAL ``docker exec`` CLIENT. When it expires, Python kills the
client and raises ``subprocess.TimeoutExpired``; the process inside the
container is never signalled, because it is not a child of the client and no
signal ever crosses the container boundary. The tool keeps running, holding its
cores, and never finishes writing the output the caller was waiting for.

MEASURED, on this repo's own ``vibeic/vibeic-eda`` container. A command
``echo <mark>; sleep 600`` invoked exactly the way ``analog_real_corner_sweep.
_docker`` invokes ngspice, with ``timeout=5``:

    client-side TimeoutExpired after 5.0s
    container-side `sleep 600` still running, count = 2

and with the deadline moved inside the container by this module:

    returned cleanly rc=124 after 5.1s
    container-side `sleep 600` survivors = 0

That is the whole defect and the whole fix. The abandoned process is why a
sizing-loop point can burn CPU-hours and never create its ``.measure.json``:
the run is not slow, it is orphaned, and the caller has already given up on it.
An orphan is invisible in exactly the way that matters — ``ps`` shows it busy,
so the host looks like it is working on the design.

THE CONTRACT
============
``run_in_container`` wraps the command in coreutils ``timeout``, which runs
INSIDE the container as the tool's own parent and can therefore signal it:

    docker exec <container> timeout -k <kill_grace> <deadline> bash -lc <cmd>

* the tool is signalled where it lives, so no orphan survives the deadline;
* ``timeout`` returns **124** on expiry, so expiry becomes an ORDINARY non-zero
  return code that existing ``returncode != 0`` handling already routes, rather
  than an exception thrown past callers that never expected one;
* ``-k`` escalates to SIGKILL for a tool that ignores SIGTERM, which several
  SPICE and layout engines do while writing;
* the client-side ``timeout=`` is RETAINED, deliberately, at
  ``deadline + _CLIENT_GRACE``. It is a backstop for the container itself being
  wedged (daemon hang, container paused), which no container-side deadline can
  cover. Because it is strictly larger, the container-side deadline always
  fires first in the normal case, so the backstop stops being the thing that
  orphans and becomes the thing that catches what orphaning would have hidden.

DEGRADE LOUDLY, NEVER SILENTLY. If ``timeout`` is absent from the image,
``TIMEOUT_UNAVAILABLE_RC`` comes back from the shell and the caller is told the
deadline could NOT be enforced, instead of the command running unbounded behind
a deadline that exists only in the caller's belief. A deadline you think you
have is worse than one you know you lack.

chip-AGNOSTIC: process lifetime and signal delivery only. No design, PDK,
vendor or tool literal appears here, and the module never inspects the command
it is given.

#
# The deadline defect this module opens with has a twin, and it was measured on

# by the container runtime's shim -- so none of those three counters describe
# the work at all.
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-07 on 8HD-8 (vibe-ic#2083), a magic LEF extraction of a
# 35 MB GDS through this exact call, sampled every 5 s from the host:
#
#     t+29s  magic cpu= 28.8s rss=1.15GB | client cpu=0.01 io=0/0 out=0 new bytes
#     t+99s  magic cpu= 99.2s rss=2.35GB | client cpu=0.01 io=0/0 out=0 new bytes
#     t+124s magic cpu=124.3s rss=2.31GB | client cpu=0.01 io=0/0 out=0 new bytes
#
# magic was pinned at a full 1.00 CPU-second per second and growing its heap by
# tens of megabytes a second. Every signal the supervisor could see sat exactly
# still -- the longest window with client CPU, client I/O and relayed output ALL
# flat was 351.9 s, against a 180 s grace -- and the run was declared
# `STALLED: no forward progress ...` and the hard macro was never produced.
#
# LEFT ALONE, that same extraction finished: 5187.5 s (86 min 27 s), exit 0,
# `DIGITAL_LEF_WRITE_DONE`, a 21494-byte abstract with 84 pins. The stall
# verdict had fired at 13.6% of the real job. The tool was never the subject of
# that verdict; the client was.

# So a `docker exec` launch supervises the CONTAINER as well. The probe below
# sums CPU and I/O over the host processes that belong to this container and
# that started after the launch -- the exec's own work, not the container's

    """Run ``cmd`` in ``container`` with NO CLOCK: reaped only on STILLNESS.

    THE DIFFERENCE FROM :func:`run_in_container`, and why it exists (owner
    ruling 2026-09-07, vibe-ic#2083). That function gives the tool a container-
    side `timeout -k 5 <deadline>`, which is a raw clock kill of a job that may
    be working perfectly — the class vibe-ic#2051 removed everywhere else. It
    is right for a call whose deadline really is a deadline; it is wrong for a
    long EDA run. MEASURED on 8HD-8 in the pinned image: the magic LEF
    extraction of a 35 MB GDS needs **5187 s** and finishes cleanly, so the
    shipped 900 s deadline would SIGTERM it at 17.4% of the job and the step
    would report "did not complete" about a tool that was never in trouble.

    The shape here is the one the supervised path already uses elsewhere:

      * `_docker_watchdog.supervised_container_command` — the shell records its
        own (pid, starttime) IDENTITY STAMP and then `exec`s the tool, so the
        stamped pid IS the tool's pid and is the leader of its process group.
        No `timeout`, no outer clock of any kind.
      * `_progress_run.run` with `container_tree_probe` — the stillness signal,
        which reads the CONTAINER's work rather than the `docker exec` client
        that cannot see it.
      * on a stall, `_docker_watchdog.kill_supervised_job` — TERM then KILL, by
        IDENTITY, so the reap can never select a stranger that happens to match
        a command line. THE ORPHAN CONTRACT IS KEPT AND SHARPENED: a still tool
        is reaped where it lives, a computing one is never cut.

    ``ceiling_s`` is a RECORDED BUDGET and stops nothing (vibe-ic#2051):
    the crossing is announced ONCE, on stderr, and the job runs on. The
    announcement is this function's to install (vibe-ic#2117): `_watchdog`
    calls an INJECTED `ceiling_notice`, `_progress_run.run` forwards one, and
    until both halves were wired every `ceiling_s` handed to this function was
    a budget whose crossing nothing outside the supervisor could observe --
    recorded in `observations`, carried back on nothing, printed nowhere.
    Pass `ceiling_notice=` to route it somewhere other than stderr.

    `poll_s` is the OBSERVATION CADENCE, not a bound on anything. `None` keeps
    the host-measured default (30 s here), which is right for a job measured in
    minutes and is also why the crossing of a small budget by a short job is
    not seen: the supervisor only looks between polls, so a job that finishes
    inside the first look after the budget is never observed to have crossed
    it. Exposed so a test can drive the announcement path against a REAL
    container command instead of asserting that it exists. The stall grace is
    `stall_looks * poll_s`, so a test that tightens the cadence must widen the
    look count or it has quietly built a clock.

    Returns the tool's own `CompletedProcess`, or one carrying `STALLED_RC`
    with the stall reason AND the reap evidence on `.stderr` — never the tool's
    rc for an outcome the tool did not reach.
