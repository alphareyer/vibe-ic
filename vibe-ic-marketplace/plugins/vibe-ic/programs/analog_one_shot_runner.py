"""analog_one_shot_runner.py — A1-A9 analog flow (parallel to Phase 2 digital).

Trigger: <project>/analog/analog_block_list.json (or analog_blocks/) present.
Skip: pure-digital ICs (no analog block declared).

Steps (canonical A1-A9, Wave 90):
  A1 spec_extract           → analog/<block>/spec.json
  A2 topology_select        → analog/<block>/topology.md
  A3 netlist_gen            → analog/<block>/<block>.sp
  A4 corner_sweep           → analog/<block>/corner_results.json
  A5 layout                 → analog/<block>/layout.mag (Magic)
  A6 block_pv               → analog/<block>/{drc,lvs} per-block DRC+LVS
  A7 post_layout_resim      → analog/<block>/pre_vs_post.json
  A8 hardmacro_gen          → analog/hardmacro/<block>/{<block>.lef,.lib,.v}
  A9 hw_verify              → analog/<block>/hw_measurements.json (HIL/co-sim)

Outputs go to <project>/analog/<block_name>/ and roll up to
<project>/reports/analog_one_shot.json. A8 LEF/lib feed back into Phase 3
(Step 15 floorplan) for mixed-signal integration.

Each Ai step delegates to the corresponding analog skill / generator under
plugins/vibe-ic/skills/analog-* (or programs/analog_*.py if a
deterministic gate exists). When a step has no deterministic implementation
yet, this runner returns WAIVED with the skill name the caller should
invoke. chip-AGNOSTIC.

Usage:
    python3 analog_one_shot_runner.py <project> [--container vibeic-eda]
                                                 [--blocks <comma-list>]

# provenance into the artefact it writes.
# ── is the artefact on disk the one THIS producer would make? ─────────────
# MEASURED (round 23): the A1-A3 producers were invoked only on the gate's
# rc 2 — the artefact-missing path. With a STALE artefact present the gate
# returned rc 0, the step reported PASS, and the producer never ran. A lane
# that had just fixed the topology library therefore simulated the OLD
# netlist — old comparator, 4 um keeper, 181 um bias — and the run looked
# identical to a successful one from the outside. A producer fix that the
# runner does not re-emit reaches nobody.
#
# The judgement is derived from what the ARTEFACT ITSELF says: each producer
# stamps a digest of its own source into the provenance it writes, and the
# runner compares that against the producer it is about to skip. NOT mtime (a
# copy or a checkout resets it) and NOT a file name (one spelling defines a
# blind population). An artefact that names no fingerprint is treated as
# unknown provenance and re-emitted, because silence is not agreement.

    ran on, and put its verdict in the ledger. vibe-ic#2080.

    WHY IT WAS UNWIRED. Under the old NAME rule it read as consulted on the
    strength of a sentence inside a string in another program:

        analog_flow_compliance_check.py:451
            "analog_block_list_emit_check for whether a list SHOULD ..."

    That is advice prose, not a call. `gate_is_wired_check`'s invocation.v1 rule
    made it visible, and nothing in the shipped tree executed it — so the ONE
    file every A-gate below reads (`_analog_a_check_common.load_block_list`)
    had its schema checked by nobody.

    WHY HERE. `main()` already refuses the ABSENT list by name (rc 2,
    FAIL_NO_BLOCK_LIST) and SKIPs the explicitly-empty one. The state neither of
    those covers is PRESENT-BUT-BROKEN, which is precisely this gate's subject.
    It is dispatched AFTER the A1-A9 loop rather than before it because A1 is
    what emits each block's `spec.json`: asked first, the `spec_file`
    resolution arm would be answering about a tree the run had not built yet.

    ADVISORY, per vibe-ic#2080 (BLOCKING only where the gate's own docstring
    says so; this one's does not). Since R-0915-85 that is said in the row
    itself: the verdict is `PASS` and `Disclosure.ADVISORY` sits beside it, and
    `verdict.run_verdict` gives a disclosure no arithmetic at all — so this row
    cannot move the analog verdict in any direction. That neutrality is pinned
    by a test rather than left as a reading of a ladder.

    THE ROW IS WRITTEN WHENEVER THE TRACK RAN, carrying PASS / FINDING /
    VACUOUS / NOT_MEASURED. `--project` is used, not file mode: the whole point
    of the gate's project arm is that it resolves each declared `spec_file` on
    disk, and file mode would report a clean schema over a list promising
    artefacts nothing produced.
