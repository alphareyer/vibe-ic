"""analog_adc_enob_corner_check.py — R12 system-ENOB per-corner gate (A4).

ENFORCEMENT: advisory

The line above is a DECLARATION, in the anchored form `flow_gate_enforcement_
audit.declared_intent` reads. This program is wired into the flow as an
`advisory_program_exit_zero` clause: it RUNS on every project that reaches its
step, its findings are printed, and its exit code cannot deny the step its PASS
tier. That is deliberate — it was wired to make a real check reachable, not to
block a landing on debt it did not create — and the declaration says so where
the audit looks. Without it, "wired where it cannot block" and "nobody decided"
are the same record, and the reliable way to stay clean is to say nothing.
For any ADC/DAC block that declares an ENOB (or SNDR) target, assert the
converter's measured effective resolution meets the spec on EVERY corner of
the corner sweep — not just the typical (TT/27C) corner. The classic escape
this closes: ENOB is measured and reported for the nominal corner only, so a
converter that meets ENOB typ but droops below it at a slow/hot corner ships
with an un-flagged spec violation. (A real hot-corner residual: an
oversampled modulator whose in-band SQNR — hence ENOB — collapses at SS/125C
because the integrator gain sags there.)

ENOB is derived from the sim-measured SNDR the standard way:

        ENOB = (SNDR_dB - 1.76) / 6.02

SNDR (and therefore ENOB) is a legitimate TOOL OUTPUT of the FFT/behavioural
converter sim — never a golden/oracle value. This gate READS that measured
output + the ENOB target from the design INPUT spec (spec.json) and compares;
it does not itself simulate.

Per block, reads:
  * phase3/analog/<block>/spec.json          — the ENOB target (design INPUT)
  * phase3/analog/<block>/corner_results.json — per-corner SNDR/ENOB (OUTPUT)

Applicability (chip-AGNOSTIC, no chip/SKU literal):
  * the block's spec.json declares a spec named `enob` OR `sndr`/`sndr_db`.
    (No ENOB/SNDR target => this is not a resolution-graded converter => SKIP.)

Per-corner resolution is read in priority order:
  1. a direct `enob` field on the corner, else
  2. computed from an SNDR field (`sndr_db` / `sndr` / `snr_db` alias) via the
     6.02/1.76 relation, else
  3. MEASURED HERE, from the corner's own A4 TRANSIENT: an FFT of the
     converter output over the simulated window, signal bin against everything
     else, `ENOB = (SNDR - 1.76) / 6.02` (see `sndr_db_from_transient`).

WHY (3) EXISTS, MEASURED (vibe-ic#2062). `ENOB >= 14` is the headline spec the
design INPUT declares for the larger of this chip's two analog blocks, and
NOTHING in the A-track measured it: the delivered testbench measures bitstream
density and swing, no corner carried an `sndr`/`enob` field, and this gate
returned `UNMEASURED / ZERO_DENOMINATOR` with `corners_seen: 9` — honest, and
still a headline spec that had never been evaluated by anything.

AND WHY IT STILL REFUSES ON THE DESIGN THAT PROMPTED IT. An FFT-based SNDR is
not a thing a gate can compute out of goodwill: it needs the converter's output
SAMPLES over the window, and it needs the input to be a COHERENT TONE, because
SNDR is the ratio of a signal bin to everything else and a DC input has no
signal bin at all. On the block in hand the emitted deck holds the input at a
DC level and dumps no waveform, so BOTH preconditions are absent — and the
refusal now SAYS WHICH ONE, per corner, by name (`_UNMEASURABLE_*` below),
instead of the single undifferentiated `no_sndr_or_enob`. A reader who is told
`stimulus_not_a_coherent_tone` can go and fix the testbench; a reader told
"no data" cannot.

Corners with none of the three are counted as UNMEASURED, each with the NAMED
reason it could not be measured. If NO corner yields a resolution the gate is
UNMEASURED (rc 2) — never a vacuous PASS and never a false FAIL.

Verdict:
  PASS  — every measured corner's ENOB >= target.
  FAIL  — >=1 measured corner ENOB < target; the finding lists each failing
          corner with its ENOB and the shortfall.
  SKIP  — no ADC/DAC block with an ENOB/SNDR target, or no per-corner
          SNDR/ENOB data present.

Exit codes: 0 = PASS / SKIP, 1 = FAIL, 2 = IO / argument error.
