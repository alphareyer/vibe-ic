"""pdk_family_identity.py — ONE canonical spelling per PDK family.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
====================
A PDK family is named by several different strings in this tree, and until
this module every reader answered "which family is that?" with its OWN
matcher.  MEASURED on c54016beddc3 (vibe-ic#2139), for the ONE family whose
registry entry is fully populated:

    selector      _registry_entry   resolve_family   _norm        device_map
    ------------  ----------------  ---------------  -----------  ----------
    ihp-sg13g2    'ihp-sg13g2'      'ihp-sg13g2'     ihpsg13g2    12 roles
    ihpsg13g2     None              None             ihpsg13g2    0 roles
    sg13g2        None              'ihp-sg13g2'     sg13g2       0 roles

The middle row is not hypothetical: ``analog_pdk_availability.resolve_pdk``
PRODUCES it — it reports ``family = _norm(target)``, punctuation stripped — so
the resolver's own output is a spelling that its own registry readers cannot
resolve.  The consequences were measured end to end:

  * ``analog_a3_netlist_emit`` REFUSED ``--pdk ihp-sg13g2`` because the block
    bound ``ihpsg13g2``, naming both spellings; and
  * ``analog_a2_topology_emit`` then refused ``--pdk ihpsg13g2`` with
    ENTRY_REQUIREMENTS_NOT_MET on four measured process constants that the
    registry entry states plainly — because the entry could not be found at
    all.

A user who follows the first refusal's hint lands on the second.  Neither
refusal is wrong about what it saw; the two readers simply do not agree on
what a family is called.

WHAT THIS MODULE IS
===================
The single authority for that question.  ``canonical_family`` answers with the
``name`` of the ``programs/pdk_registry.json`` entry a selector denotes — the
one published spelling — and every producer that needs a family id resolves
through it, so a selector that resolves for one of them cannot silently fail
to resolve for another.

The alias table is the REGISTRY ITSELF: there is no hand-typed list of
spellings here and no PDK literal anywhere in this file.  Matching is
structural on the NORMALISED strings (case folded, punctuation dropped),
strongest rule first, and an ambiguous selector resolves to nothing rather
than to a guess:

    exact          normalised strings equal
    prefix         one normalised string starts the other
    containment    one normalised string occurs inside the other
    token          a WORD of one occurs inside the other, which is how a
                   declaration like `sg13g2_maximal` names a family

with a four-character floor on every side that has to carry the match,
because a token that short does not identify a family and answering from it
would invent a finding.

chip-AGNOSTIC and NDA-safe: names come from the registry, never from here.
