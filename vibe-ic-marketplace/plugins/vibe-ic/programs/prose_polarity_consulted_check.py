"""A prose extractor that never asks whether the sentence DENIES the value.

THIS GATE BLOCKS (rc=1) on a NEW one.

WHY (vibe-ic#712)
-----------------
It happened twice in one day, in two fields, found by the same activity —
retargeting a design from one process to another:

    #706  pdk_target          "This block is NOT targeted at <PDK>."
                              -> pdk_target = <PDK>, outranking the design's own
                                 labelled declaration three lines below.
    #711  die_area_budget_um  a document saying the old fixed die "has NO
                              meaning here and is REMOVED, not translated"
                              re-declared that exact rectangle as a mandate.

Neither is cosmetic. `die_area_budget_um` sits above `auto` in the phase-3
runner's documented precedence, so the design is hard-sized onto a die belonging
to a different chip — citing the design's own document as the authority. Nothing
warned; the floorplan read as declared rather than inherited.

WHAT IT MEASURES
----------------
Not "is this extractor correct" — that is a semantic question and a program that
guessed would produce confident wrong answers. It asks the structural one the
two defects share:

    a function that SEARCHES prose for a value and WRITES that value into a
    declared field, without ever consulting the polarity vocabulary.

A function is in scope when it both matches prose (a module-level `re` pattern
or an inline `re.search`/`findall` over a text argument) and assigns into a
record. It is CLEAN when it reaches `_prose_polarity` — directly, or through a
local alias of one of its names.

WHY NOT A LINT ON THE FIELD NAMES. Because the field is not the tell. Both
defects were in different fields, in different files, written by different
authors, weeks apart. What they share is the shape.

BASELINE, AND WHY IT MAY ONLY SHRINK
------------------------------------
Extractors that predate the vocabulary are recorded, not failed: failing a
pre-existing pile on day one is how a gate ends up switched off, and this repo
has measured that. Anything NEW fails from the first run.

A SHRINK IS A PASS, AND THE COUNT GUARD IT USED TO NAME WAS LAUNDERING
----------------------------------------------------------------------
An extractor that learns to consult polarity makes the register TOO BIG, and
this gate used to answer that with "Re-run with --write-baseline". MEASURED on
the tree this paragraph was written against, that instruction was live
laundering: the population read `polarity-blind 213 (baseline 213)` while
`spec_numeric_pack_extract::_detect_rounding_modes` had LEFT the set and
`_area_unit::liberty_areas` had JOINED it, and the write path's only guard was

    if prev and len(now) > len(prev): refuse

a COUNT. Running the flag the gate had just recommended exited 0 and recorded
the brand-new offender as accepted debt at unchanged size 213 — no size moved,
so nothing looked wrong to a reader either. `flow_gate_enforcement_audit` had
removed this exact hole from itself under vibe-ic#900 ("RATCHET ON MEMBERSHIP,
NOT ON COUNT"); this gate still carried it.

It is a membership test now, and a tightening is recorded by `--record-shrink`,
which writes `previous & current` and cannot add — see `_ratchet_baseline`. The
verdict path never writes: the hygiene suite runs inside the whole-repo
`suite_write_guard` bracket at `tools/gatekeeper-land.sh:690`, which blocks on
any tracked write.

chip-AGNOSTIC: pure AST structure. No chip, PDK, vendor or field literal.

        "purpose -- the exact failure this mechanism exists to prevent. Worse, "
        "the convention's REQUIRED terminal keyword is `excluded`, which IS a "
        "member of the vocabulary (`\\bexclud\\w*\\b`), so the consult would "
        "fire on EVERY marker of EVERY design and switch the mechanism off "
        "entirely. MEASURED by planting it: NINE of the fifteen tests in that "
        "fixture go red -- both core direction tests, all three older mutation "

#: THE OFFENDER REGISTER — a RATCHET BY MEMBERSHIP, and it is SOURCE.
#:
#: The count was never the instrument. MEASURED across v1.17.51..v1.17.83 the
#: polarity-blind population went 212 -> 213 -> 214 -> 213 -> 214 -> 215, because
#: entries both ENTER and LEAVE; bisecting that number names the wrong landing,
#: while reading the SET named every offender in one pass. So what is pinned here
#: is membership.
#:
#: THE RULE (`--ratchet`): the gate fails when an offender is NOT in this
#: register — that is a landing ADDING one, and it is blocked. Shrinking is
#: welcome: the entry is DELETED IN THE SAME COMMIT that fixes the offender, and
#: an entry left behind after its offender is gone is itself an offender, so the
#: register cannot rot into a list of things that used to be true.
#:
#: THIS IS NOT A BASELINE AND THERE IS NO FLAG THAT WRITES IT. `--write-baseline`
#: and `--record-shrink` write files; this is reviewed like any other source, in
#: the diff, with the owner of each entry named so a reader knows who to ask.
#: The gate printing an errand that points at a write flag is what made the
#: previous shape unusable — a lane fixing one offender was invited to record
#: every other offender that run happened to see as accepted debt.
#:
#: EMPTY, AND THAT IS THE MEANING OF THE RULE, NOT A GAP IN IT. The sole entry
#: (`design_one_shot_runner::_chip_top_resolve_excluded_variant_params`, owner
#: lane czaes1, added by v1.17.85) was deleted in the commit that resolved its
#: offender -- as a `_NOT_PROSE` entry with its argument and its falsifier
#: (#2102 row 2), the function reading SystemVerilog module-item grammar out of
#: text its own two gatherers have already stripped. An entry that outlives its
#: offender is itself an offender and `_ratchet_verdict` refuses it, so leaving
#: this one behind would have moved the red rather than closed it.

    _resolve_excluded_variant_params` became an offender at v1.17.85, and

    that landing a correct entry for it was reported STALE, purely because the
    module file exists and the function does not. That is the same
    tree-dependence the paragraph above forbids, one level down: an entry naming
