"""The ONE place the plugin says WHICH EDA image, and WHICH container holds it.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
======================
Two facts were being answered in two different places, and they disagreed.

MEASURED 2026-09-07 on 8hd-3, with `VIBEIC_EDA_IMAGE_REPO` exported and the
pinned image present::

    $ python3 -c 'import _eda_image as E; print(E.judged_image().ref)'
    ghcr.io/vibeic/vibeic-eda@sha256:f6b09c1388c6…      # the 0.3.16 LOCAL TAG

while the pin every landing site names is
``sha256:8da785a8d3275884ad0d0ee0fb10f7e90d8b7bf11a08d38e9559b0764112480f``,
which was on that host, pulled, under the configured repository. A
verdict-bearing gate judged 0.3.16 while the operator believed it had pinned
0.3.47. Nothing warned, because nothing on the RUN path had ever read the pin:
``VIBEIC_EDA_IMAGE_REPO`` was read by exactly one shipped file
(``landing_pytest_runtime_preflight``) and by nothing that runs a tool.

THE PIN IS THE DIGEST. THE REPOSITORY IS DEPLOYMENT CONFIGURATION.
==================================================================
Stated first by ``tools/ci/hermetic_candidate_runner.py``, and this module is
the plugin-side half of the SAME statement, spelled with the same constant
names so the two cannot drift without a test noticing. The digest names the
bytes and is the identity — it is what every check here actually asserts. The
repository names a place those bytes can be fetched from, and which place a
given host can reach is a fact about the network, not about the runtime: the
same image, distributed to five hosts, carries the same repo digest on every
host that pulled it, while its image Id differs by storage driver.

So a deployment that serves the same bytes from elsewhere sets one env. It does
NOT edit this file, and it CANNOT change which bytes are demanded.

A DIGEST IS NOT A VERSION, AND THAT DISTINCTION IS THE WHOLE POINT
==================================================================
``_eda_image``'s own guards forbid a pinned *version* — ``vibeic-eda:0.3.16`` —
in any shipped program, and they are right: a version literal freezes silently
and keeps running an older toolchain than everything around it, and it costs a
cross-repo check-in per release. None of that is true of a digest. A version is
a NAME its publisher can re-point at other bytes; a digest IS the bytes. The
guard regex (``vibeic-eda:\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+``) draws exactly this line, and
this module stays on the right side of it.

WHAT REFUSAL LOOKS LIKE
=======================
Never a fallback to another tag or another version. A host that does not hold
the pinned bytes is a host that cannot answer, and it says so by name:

    IMAGE_NOT_PRESENT: <repo>@sha256:<digest>

"I could not open the pinned image" and "I opened it and it was bad" must never
reach a reader as the same verdict — the same rule every other input in this
repo is held to.

A CONTAINER NAME IS NOT A CONTAINER IDENTITY
============================================
The second half, and the second measured defect. Every ``--container`` in this
plugin defaulted to the SHARED name ``vibeic-eda``, and no override could move
it apart from ``VIBEIC_EDA_CONTAINER``. MEASURED 2026-09-07 on 8hd-3: the
container actually named ``vibeic-eda`` on that host was running image
``sha256:06537f7e…`` (0.3.46) while the pin demanded ``sha256:8da785a8…``. A run
that attached to it recorded image provenance PASS about the WRONG image — the
report named a digest, so it looked reproducible, and it was reproducibly wrong.

A name is not a measurement. So:

  * the DEFAULT container name is DERIVED from the required digest
    (``vibeic-eda-<first 12 hex>``), which makes two different pins two
    different containers by construction, and makes the collision above
    impossible to reach by default rather than merely unlikely;
  * attaching to an EXISTING container is allowed only when that container's
    image digest IS the required one. Otherwise ``CONTAINER_IMAGE_MISMATCH``,
    naming BOTH digests, because a refusal that does not say what it found is a
    refusal the reader cannot act on;
  * "the container is gone" and "the container is the wrong image" are
    different answers and are returned as different codes.

chip-AGNOSTIC: image and container identity only. No design, PDK, vendor, IC or
host-address literal appears here — the fleet's registry is CONFIGURATION and
is never written into this tree.

#: THE IDENTITY IS RESOLVED, NOT REMEMBERED.
#:
#: This module used to carry the digest as a literal, which made adopting a new
#: EDA image an edit to plugin SOURCE — two repositories with two release
#: cadences forced to move together. `f1653caa4`
#: ("stop storing vibeic-eda's version number in this repo") had already removed
#: exactly that coupling; `11a82fb68` reintroduced it while fixing a real
#: incident (one host naming three different images in one minute). Both
#: properties are kept here: the digest is still the IDENTITY every verdict is
#: recorded against, and it is still compared before attaching to a container —
#: it is simply ASKED FOR rather than stored.
#:
#: RESOLUTION ORDER — the one `_eda_image.judged_image` documented before the pin:
#:
#:   1. an explicit `VIBEIC_EDA_IMAGE` / `IIC_EDA_IMAGE` override, reduced to its
#:      digest. Naming an image by hand is the operator's deliberate call.
#:   2. the vibeic-eda image ALREADY ON THIS HOST, newest first, by its digest.
#:      No network and no pull — and, the load-bearing half, **a local image
#:      cannot move under you**, so two gates in one run cannot resolve to
#:      different bytes.
#:   3. the registry, ONLY when the caller passes `allow_pull=True`. A gate that
#:      silently starts a multi-gigabyte fetch is a gate people switch off.
#:
#: RESOLVED ONCE PER PROCESS. The first read fixes the answer for the whole run,
#: which is the run-wide consistency the literal was reaching for.
#:
#: UNRESOLVABLE IS NOT A VERDICT. With none of the three available this raises
#: `ImageNotResolvable` rather than returning a string nobody measured: "I could
#: not read which image this is" and "I read it and it was the wrong one" must
#: never reach a caller in the same shape — the same rule `CONTAINER_IMAGE_MISMATCH`
#: and `IMAGE_NOT_PRESENT` already state for their own failures.
