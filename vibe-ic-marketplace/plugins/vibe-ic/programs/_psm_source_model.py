"""PSM's supply-source model on a block whose PDN straps are its supply pins.

WHY THIS EXISTS. A padless block (a core / hard macro) promotes its PDN strap
layers to supply PINS (`define_pdn_grid -pins`, see
`phase3_one_shot_runner._core_block_pin_layers_tcl`), because whoever
instantiates it reaches its supply through those ports. OpenROAD PSM, given no
`-vsrc` file, takes EVERY BPin shape as an ideal voltage source
(`IRSolver::generateSourceNodes`: sources from BTerms first, the generated
FULL/STRAPS/BUMPS pattern only when that set is empty). Promoting the straps
therefore silently turned every strap into an ideal supply: MEASURED on the
same spm x gf180mcuD layout, Metal4 strap current read exactly 0 A, the EM
peak fell 4.3x and the static IR 2-5x, and PSM-0073 (the generated bump
pattern the IR record declares as its conservative model) disappeared. Nothing
in the layout got better; the measurement stopped looking at the straps.

THE RULE. The supply pins a padless block ships are an INTERFACE, not a
source model. Every PSM session (static IR/EM, transient IR, the pre-route EM
presweep) marks them with PSM's own `PSM_DISCONNECT` BPin property
(`BPinNode::shouldConnect`) before solving, so PSM falls back to exactly the
model it used before the pins existed, and says so on a marker line the
records read back. The pins stay in the database and in the DEF.

WHICH PINS. Exactly the ones the promotion rule creates: the SPECIAL BTerms of
a POWER/GROUND net on a block with no placed pad master (the same database
fact the promotion keys on). A block with placed pads promotes nothing and is
left untouched, so a die keeps its pad-sourced model byte-for-byte.
