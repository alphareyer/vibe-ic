"""container_image_provenance.py — record, and on request enforce, which IMAGE the run's `--container` actually executes.

Why this exists
---------------
Every containerised step in the flow is dispatched as
`docker exec <container> ...`, so `--container` names a **container**, not an
image. Nothing in the runner ever asked which image that container was started
from. Two consequences, both measured on a real sign-off run:

  1. **Stale-container substitution (silent).** The default container name
     resolves to whatever long-running container happens to exist. An operator
     who has pulled and intends to run image `X` can have the entire run execute
     on an older image `Y` — every tool version, every PDK, every sign-off
     number — with NOTHING in the run record naming `Y`. The run looks clean and
     is attributed to the wrong toolchain.

  2. **Image-ref passed as a container name (soft degradation).** Passing the
     natural thing — an image ref like `repo/name:tag` — matches no container, so
     `docker exec` fails for every step. The runner does not stop; steps fall
     through to their "container unavailable" branches (e.g. the SV-frontend
     fallback reports `could not create container workdir`) and the run reports a
     downstream tool FAILURE rather than the real cause.

This program makes the image identity FIRST-CLASS: recorded always, enforced on
request. It is chip-, PDK- and tool-AGNOSTIC.

Usage
-----
    container_image_provenance.py --container vibeic-eda
    container_image_provenance.py --container vibeic-eda \\
        --require-image vibeic-eda:0.2.30 --json reports/container_image.json

Exit codes
----------
    0 = identity resolved (and matched --require-image when given), OR an
        honest SKIP (docker binary absent). The JSON always says which.
    1 = the named container does not exist
    2 = the container exists but its image does not match --require-image
    3 = usage / io error
