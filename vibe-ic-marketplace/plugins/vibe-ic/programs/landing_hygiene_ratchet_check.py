"""landing_hygiene_ratchet_check.py — the LANDING refuses a hygiene finding
that this landing INTRODUCES, even under a label that is already red.

THIS GATE BLOCKS (rc=1), AND REFUSES RATHER THAN GUESSES (rc=2).

THE DEFECT (vibe-ic#2176), MEASURED ON MAIN
===========================================
`tools/gatekeeper-land.sh --cheap-only` prints

    --- full tier SKIPPED (--cheap-only) — no stamp will be written ---

at line 807 and exits at line 808 — BEFORE `--- full tier ---` at line 811 and
therefore before `run_capture "full:repo-hygiene"` at line 2004, which is the
only thing in this repository that runs `tools/ci/repo_hygiene_gates.sh`.  The
direct-push landing path uses `--cheap-only`.  So the 154-gate hygiene tier,
the ONLY instrument that measures the hygiene gates, never runs at landing.

The consequence, measured over `origin/main` on 2026-09-07 across 140 landings
(v1.17.99 -> v1.19.38): of the seven hygiene gates red on main, SIX were made
red that same day by this repository's own landings.  `shipped-path
portability` — BLOCKING since 2026-07-20 — went

    577fb50d3^  0 non-portable paths
    577fb50d3   4     (#2158)
    dbba4729c   9     (#2165)

green -> red across a landing, then worse across a second, and the landing gate
said `LAND GATE OK` both times.  This lane re-measured the endpoint on 8HD-8 in
its own clone of `a1f3685837ca`: 9 findings in 5860 files.  Nothing is wrong
with the gate; the process that was supposed to run it did not.

WHY THIS IS A DELTA AND NOT THE GATE ITSELF
===========================================
The obvious repair — run `shipped_path_portability_check.py` as a cheap landing
gate — refuses EVERY landing, because main already carries 9 findings.  A bar
that is red every day is the bar people learn to bypass, which is how this
repository got `--no-verify` on the evening of 2026-08-29.

The rule that is both true and enforceable is the one the TEST tier has had
since vibe-ic#1019 and `hygiene_finding_delta.py` was written to give the
hygiene tier: main is red, so a landing is refused when its finding set is NOT
a SUBSET of the base's.  What must be empty is the DIFFERENCE, never the count.

This program is that rule at the granularity of ONE GATE, computed from two
arms of the same instrument, cheaply enough to run on the landing path.  It
does not replace the hygiene tier and it does not make the tier cheaper: the
tier still runs every one of its gates, unchanged, wherever it runs today.

WHY A COUNT APPEARS HERE AND WHY IT IS NOT A COUNT RATCHET
==========================================================
Identity is `(path, rule)` — deliberately NOT `(path, line, rule)`.  A line
number is not a property of the finding; inserting an unrelated import above an
offender moves every line below it, and a line-keyed identity would present the
whole tail of a file as introduced by a landing that touched none of it.

But `(path, rule)` alone is too coarse for the very landing this gate exists
for: `dbba4729c` added `legacy_external_reference_debt.py:52` and `:54` to a
file that ALREADY held `:14`, so all three collapse to one key and the landing
would read as introducing nothing.  So the per-key OCCURRENCE COUNT is compared
too, and a key whose count GREW is an introduction.

That is not the count ratchet this repository forbids.  A count ratchet pins a
whole-population number, so REMOVING an offender elsewhere pays for ADDING one
here and tightening a rule is punished.  This compares per-key counts in ONE
direction only: growth blocks, shrinkage is free, and a key that disappears is
never mentioned.  There is no total, so there is nothing to trade against.

BOTH ARMS ARE THE SAME POPULATION, BY CONSTRUCTION
==================================================
Both arms are materialised with `git archive <rev> | tar -x`, so both are the
tracked tree at their own revision and neither can see a worktree leftover.
This matters concretely: `shipped_path_portability_check.py` enumerates
git-tracked files when it is pointed at a git checkout and falls back to a
filesystem walk when it is not.  Measured on this lane's clone, the two modes
report the SAME population and the SAME findings over the same commit —
`9 non-portable path(s) in 5860 file(s) scanned (git-tracked)` and
`... (filesystem-walk)` — but relying on that coincidence would leave the two
arms asking subtly different questions.  Archiving both makes them one question.

THE INSTRUMENT IS THE CANDIDATE'S; THE SUBJECT IS EACH ARM'S OWN
================================================================
The checker program is taken from `--plugin-root` (the candidate) for BOTH
arms.  Taking each arm's own copy of the checker would mean a landing that
TIGHTENS a rule reports every pre-existing offender the tightened rule now sees
as introduced, and would be refused for improving the gate.  Only the subject
tree varies between arms; the question does not.

EVERY REFUSAL BLOCKS
====================
If either arm cannot be run, or its output cannot be parsed into the shape this
program declares, the verdict is rc=2 REFUSED and the landing stops.  "Could
not measure it" is never reported as "measured it and it was clean" — a landing
gate that cannot measure must never report that it measured.
