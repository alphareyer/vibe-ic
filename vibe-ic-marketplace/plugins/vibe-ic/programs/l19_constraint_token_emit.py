"""l19_constraint_token_emit.py — lift the constraints a design states in its
OWN PROSE into L19, the layer that carries them.

VERDICT SEMANTICS: **REPAIRS** (exit 0 unless L19 is unreadable). Not a gate.
ENFORCEMENT: **ADVISORY producer** at the Phase-1 runner boundary.  A missing
declaration emits zero and changes nothing; an unreadable L19 returns a named
ERROR which the runner prints as a named fail-open adapter failure.

The measured defect
------------------------------------------------------------------
Reproduced on a real Phase-1 document run at pre-fix `origin/main`
(`5062b12480fb`, plugin v1.15.14). The design's L9 input document states:

    §9.1   an SDC block containing `set_units` and `create_clock`
    §9.1.3 `set_input_delay` / `set_output_delay` at 20% of the period
    §9.1B  a `MAX_FANOUT_CONSTRAINT` table, per std-cell library
    §9.2.1 an `FP_CORE_UTIL` / `PL_TARGET_DENSITY` table, per PDK family
    §9.3   `FP_PDN_VOFFSET` / `FP_PDN_HOFFSET` / `FP_PDN_SKIPTRIM`

and the emitted `L19_CONSTRAINTS_PDK.json` carried NONE of them. Measured
with the plugin's own `phase1_expert_parse_track.phrase_present` over the
emitted layer: 10 of 10 tokens present in the input, 0 of 10 present in L19.

The layer did not merely omit them. It stated the opposite:

    "constraints_present": false,
    "notes": "Spec does not state PDK / timing constraints; these are
              deferred to integration."

A missing fact is a hole a downstream consumer can notice. A stated
falsehood is one it cannot: the note is the half a human reads, and it
told the reader to stop looking.

Why the existing ingest did not cover it
------------------------------------------------------------------
`_post_emit_sdc_constraints` reads STAGED `*.sdc` FILES and
`_post_emit_floorplan_contract` reads a STAGED OpenLane `config.json` /
`DIE_AREA`. Both are correct and neither applies here: this design ships
no deck and no config — it ships the constraint as a table in a document,
which is the normal shape for a specification handed to an implementer.
So the two file-based ingests found nothing, `constraints_present` was
never set, and `spi_protocol_synth`'s neutral overlay (which uses
`setdefault`, and therefore yields to any real extraction) filled the gap
with the false negative and its note.

That overlay is ALREADY built to yield: its own block comment records the
same class of contradiction ("an L19 carrying a `pdk_target` read from the
design's own input prose … was emitted alongside a note saying the spec
does not include PDK / timing constraints"). It just had nothing to yield
TO. This emitter is that missing producer, and it is wired to run BEFORE
the overlay so the existing `setdefault` + contradiction machinery does
the rest — no module here rewrites another module's note.

What is emitted, and what is NOT
------------------------------------------------------------------
`fields.constraint_declarations[]`, one record per DECLARATION:

    kind        "flow_setting" | "sdc_directive"
    token       the key (`FP_CORE_UTIL`) or the directive (`create_clock`)
    value       the bound value, for a flow setting; absent for a directive
    scope       the design's own scope for the value — the row key of a
                column-oriented table (a std-cell library, a PDK family).
                NEVER dropped: two rows of one table are two different
                targets, and collapsing them lets the last one win.
    section     the heading PATH the design filed it under
    domain_anchor  the part of that path (or of the document title) that
                files it under the constraints domain — see `_DOMAIN_RE`.
                Recorded so "why is this in L19" is answerable FROM THE
                LAYER rather than by re-running the extractor.
    source/line project-relative provenance
    evidence    the document's own row

Three implementation-context fields are also projected when, and only when,
the design's own prose declares them explicitly:

    fields.reference_flow[]         a NAMED reference-flow path plus the
                                    surrounding declaration; the path is
                                    recorded but never opened here
    fields.implementation_route[]   a section explicitly labelled as the
                                    implementation route / intended path
    fields.verification_oracle[]    a section explicitly labelled as the
                                    verification oracle; names only, never
                                    oracle contents

These are L19 implementation context, not constraints, so they do not set
`constraints_present`.  They carry the same project-relative source, line,
evidence and extraction-strategy provenance as constraint declarations.

Whether or not anything is lifted, the layer records THE READ SET —
`documents_consulted[]`, every input document this emitter opened with a
`yielded` flag — outside `fields`, because reading a document is not
extracting from it. Without it a layer that carries only prompt-stated facts
is indistinguishable from one whose emitter never opened the design
documents, and the two were in fact confused (vibe-ic#2128).

`constraints_present` becomes True — and ONLY on evidence. With no
declaration found, this emitter writes nothing at all and the layer keeps
whatever the file-based ingests and the overlay put there, which is the
honest state for a design that really did defer its constraints.

NOT emitted:
  * no `*_status` result field — Phase 1 reads a specification, and a
    specification states targets, not outcomes;
  * no clock PERIOD table. `create_clock`'s per-library period is owned by
    `sdc_constraints` / the L8 clock-domain ingest, and a second producer
    for one fact is how two layers come to disagree. The directive record
    carries the period row as `evidence` so the provenance is not lost.

Refusals (never invent a constraint)
------------------------------------------------------------------
  * a key with no value bound to it is a MENTION, not a setting, and is
    dropped — see `constraint_prose_tokens.table_bindings`;
  * a key the design filed under some OTHER subject is that subject's, not
    this layer's. A CPU's `IC_SIZE_BYTES` belongs to L8, a crypto block's
    `KEY_SHARE0_0` to L5, a power IC's `VOUT_COMMAND` to L15. See the
    DOMAIN ANCHOR block below — it is the correction a corpus sweep forced,
    and without it this emitter put ~350 of another layer's constants into
    the constraints layer across the tracked corpus;
  * a code block is CODE. `export TOOLCHAIN=/path` has the exact shape of a
    setting and is not one — see `constraint_prose_tokens._code_block_lines`;
  * duplicate corpora are counted once. Path A ships each input as both
    `phase1/input_doc/x.txt` and `input/docs/x.md`; the same declaration
    read twice is one declaration, and an evidence count that doubles
    with the corpus layout is a copy count wearing an evidence count's
    name;
  * re-running is idempotent — a declaration already present for the same
    (kind, token, scope, value) is not duplicated, and an existing entry
    is never modified or removed.

chip-AGNOSTIC: SDC command names, UPPER_SNAKE key SHAPE, and the
physical-design DOMAIN vocabulary. No design name, PDK name, cell-library
name or vendor literal anywhere in this file or in
`constraint_prose_tokens` — and note that being chip-agnostic was never the
hard part. The rejected alternative (a whitelist of one tool's variable
names) is equally chip-agnostic and equally wrong; what separates them is
what each puts in the layer, which only a corpus sweep can tell you.

    """L19's record of the clock target — or of its ABSENCE (vibe-ic#2091).

    WHY AN ABSENCE IS A RECORD
    ==========================
    Measured on opentitan_aes x sky130A: the input states no target clock
    period anywhere, L19 said nothing about that, and the flow went on to sign
    off post-route timing against a period it supplied itself (WNS -42.140 ns)
    with no artefact anywhere saying the number was never asked for.

    A layer that is SILENT about a missing constraint and a layer that is
    silent about a constraint it simply did not read are indistinguishable
    downstream, and only one of them is a question for the user.  So the
    absence is written down, with the sentence the input would have had to
    contain, exactly as `clock_target_provenance` phrases it for the STA
    record.  Nothing is defaulted here: when nothing is stated, no number is
    published — only the fact that nothing is stated.

    WHY THIS RECORD DOES NOT NAME A PDK OF ITS OWN (vibe-ic#2159)
    =============================================================
    Measured on `subservient` (lane rbsub6, 8HD-9): this record read
    ``pdk: "sky130", tier: "l8_declared", period_ns: 20.0`` while the run's own
    record read ``pdk: "gf180mcuD", tier: "declared_pdk_table",
    period_ns: 20.0`` citing ``L9_constraints_floorplan.md:34`` — and the
    design's own table in that very file gives ``sky130_fd_sc_hd -> 10 ns``.
    So "sky130 -> 20 ns" contradicted the document it was derived beside.

    The mechanism was this function: it read the PDK from L19's own
    ``pdk_target`` — the technology the DOCUMENTS name as intended — and then
    stamped that name onto a period that the PDK-keyed tier had not produced
    (``l8_declared`` is a PDK-INDEPENDENT tier: an L8 ``clock_mhz``).  A PDK
    name beside a number is a claim that the number belongs to that PDK, and
    here it did not.

    The contract this now follows:

      * when the RUN has published its own provenance, L19 records the SAME
        pdk, tier and period — one run, one answer;
      * otherwise L19 names a PDK only when the tier that answered is itself
        PDK-KEYED (`declared_pdk_table` matched a row for that library);
      * in every other case the pdk is ``NOT_STATED``.  The document-declared
        intent is preserved under ``pdk_target_declared``, which no reader can
        mistake for "the PDK this number belongs to".

    Never another PDK's tier carrying this PDK's number.

    Returns None when the provenance reader is unavailable, which is
    NOT_MEASURED and must not be written as an absence.

#
# Measured: on `benchmark-data/ic/opentitan_aes` this emitter opens all eight
# design documents under `input/docs/` and every record it emits nevertheless
# cites the prompt, because the prompt is the only input that states a
# declaration in an admitted shape. Read from the layer alone that is
# indistinguishable from (b) — and it was read as (b), and filed as a defect
# (vibe-ic#2128). The read set is the one field that separates them.
#
# It is provenance, never a constraint: it is written outside `fields`, it
# never sets `constraints_present`, and it never advances `extraction_status`
# — reading a document is not extracting from it.
