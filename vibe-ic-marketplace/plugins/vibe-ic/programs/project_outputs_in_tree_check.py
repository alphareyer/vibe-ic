"""project_outputs_in_tree_check.py

Closes the silent-loss bug where build / EDA tools write outputs to
``/tmp/`` (or other volatile locations outside the project tree) and the
agent forgets to copy them back. The next reboot / tmpfs sweep destroys
the evidence. Worse, gate authors then waiver the missing canonical-path
artifacts thinking they were never produced.

Concrete failure mode (project-agnostic example):
    PnR / GDS tools accept caller-supplied output paths. When agents
    pick a scratch dir under /tmp/, the artifacts are real but live
    on volatile tmpfs. waivers.json + RESULT.md then cite those paths
    and a later audit assumes the artifacts were never produced — so
    spurious waivers get opened for results that DO exist, just outside
    the project tree. A reboot or tmpfs sweep then permanently destroys
    the evidence.

This gate is **chip-AGNOSTIC**:

    Scan the project's waivers.json + RESULT.md + reports/*.json for
    any reference to absolute paths starting with /tmp/, /var/tmp/,
    or any path explicitly outside the project root. FAIL when one is
    found in a canonical declaration file, whether or not the file is
    still on disk:

      * still on disk  — the artifact got produced but was left outside
        the project tree. Recoverable: copy it in.
      * already gone   — the reference is dangling, so the artifact was
        produced and then swept. Worse, and NOT recoverable.

    #2084: this paragraph used to read "FAIL when found AND the
    referenced file actually exists", which described only the first of
    the two while `main()` has always exited 1 on both (`fail_count =
    len(live) + len(dangling)`). The prose was the narrower of two
    classifications the file carried at once; the code's is the one that
    decides, so the prose is corrected to it rather than the reverse —
    a dangling reference names evidence that is already lost, which is
    not the half of this finding to stop blocking on.

    The fix is for the agent to copy live artifacts to canonical
    locations under <project>/ before claiming completion.

    #2158: THE POPULATION IS NOT THE PREFIX LIST. Those four directories
    are one common way to land in this condition, not the condition. A
    third blocking class is derived from the RUN ROOT instead of from a
    list: an absolute path cited in a canonical declaration file that
    resolves OUTSIDE the project and is NOT ON DISK — a location this run
    used and did not preserve — whatever prefix it carries. Measured on
    two lanes at the same plugin tip, the same lost-scratch-path defect
    FAILED under `TMPDIR=/tmp/lane.<lane>` and PASSED under a TMPDIR
    beneath `$HOME`; the verdict turned on the operator's environment.
    Deliberately narrow: an outside path that IS on disk (a toolchain
    root, a PDK, another checkout) is untouched, because it names
    something a reader can still follow. `_PATH_RE` itself is unchanged —
    `collect_external_outputs.py` imports it to decide what to COPY.

Honors waiver ``project_artifacts_external_storage_intentional`` (>=60
chars per offending path).

ENFORCEMENT: **BLOCKING.** A rc-1 from this gate STOPS the run — it does not
merely record and continue. Stated here because `flow-change-acceptance` §5 is
explicit that silence is not neutral: an unstated default of "advisory" is how
62 of 72 gates in this repo ended up unable to stop anything, which is not what
any of their authors intended.

PROVEN BY RUN, not inferred from the wiring (§3; the doctrine's own measured
warning is `cts_quality_check`, which returned FAIL with no waiver on three
consecutive versions while the flow shipped a routed DEF anyway). Scoping
`_STRUCTURAL_RTL_GATES` to this gate alone and varying ONE thing — whether a
blocking external reference is present — moves the umbrella:

    clean tree     -> gate PASS, umbrella passed=True,  status=PASS
    one reference  -> gate FAIL, umbrella passed=False, status=FAIL

The unscoped form of that experiment is VACUOUS and was run first: on a minimal
synthetic tree other gates fail too, so the umbrella reads FAIL on both arms and
the comparison says nothing. The scoped control is the one that measures this
gate.

Usage:
    python3 project_outputs_in_tree_check.py <project_dir>

Exit codes:
    0  PASS (>=1 declaration file was READ and none cites external storage,
       OR every citation is waived)
    1  FAIL (a /tmp-class reference in a canonical declaration file — live
       (artifact still on disk, copy it in) or dangling (already swept, the
       evidence is gone), OR (#2158) a reference to any path outside the
       project root that is not on disk. All three block; the split states the remedy, not
       whether there is a finding. The FIRST line of stdout is always the
       `[FAIL]` line naming the blocking population, because
       `flow_compliance_check._p0_first_line` publishes line 0 as the
       failed gate's reason — see the #2084 block in `main()`)
    2  NOT_CHECKED — IO / parse error, OR the scan opened ZERO declaration
       files: nothing was read, so nothing is vouched for (#619; the argument
       is written out at the `scanned == 0` branch of main())

# ── #2158 — THE POPULATION IS "A PATH THAT WILL NOT EXIST AFTER THE RUN" ─────
#
# `_VOLATILE_PREFIXES` / `_PATH_RE` above are a HARD LIST of four directories.
# They are not the definition of the thing this gate is for; they are one
# common way to land in it. The fleet's own standing brief mandates
# `TMPDIR=/tmp/lane.<lane>/`, and lanes that follow it were caught while a lane
# whose TMPDIR sat under `$HOME` was equally dangling and completely invisible.
#
# MEASURED (lanes rbsub5 and rbsub6, 8HD-9, 2026-09-07, same plugin tip): both
# runs recorded a scratch path in `reports/orchestrator/phase2_one_shot.json`
# that no longer existed. rbsub6's began `/tmp/lane.rbsub6/…` and FAILED this
# gate; rbsub5's began `/home/<your-user>/…` and PASSED it. The only variable
# between the two verdicts was where TMPDIR happened to point — a property of
# the operator's environment, not of the run's honesty.
#
# THE DERIVED POPULATION. Rather than lengthening the list of prefixes, which
# can only ever chase the last environment someone used, the gate derives the
# class from the RUN ROOT it was given: an absolute path cited in a canonical
# declaration file, resolving OUTSIDE the project root, that is NOT ON DISK, is
# a dangling reference to something the run cannot produce again — whatever
# directory it lived in. That is the same finding `dangling` already blocks on
# for `/tmp`, stated by its meaning instead of by its spelling.
#
# WHY NON-EXISTENCE IS PART OF THE DEFINITION AND NOT A SOFTENING OF IT. A path
# outside the tree that IS on disk is the enormous, mostly-legitimate class of
# system and toolchain references (`/usr/bin/…`, a PDK root, another checkout);
# blocking on those would make the gate unusable and would say nothing about
# lost evidence. A path outside the tree that is GONE is, by construction,
# either evidence that was swept or a location that never existed — and either
# way a reader following it gets nothing. Only the second class is added here.
#
# `_PATH_RE` IS DELIBERATELY NOT WIDENED. `collect_external_outputs.py` imports
# it (`_gate._PATH_RE`) to decide which LIVE artefacts to copy into the tree;
# widening it there would send that collector after `/usr/bin/...`. The new
# population gets its own expression, and the volatile-prefix behaviour — live
# and dangling alike — is byte-identical to before.
# THE LOOKBEHIND IS WIDER THAN `_PATH_RE`'S, AND THE CENSUS IS WHY. Measured
# over 6847 published run roots on 8HD-8 (2026-09-07, lane cz2158): reusing
# `_PATH_RE`'s `(?<![A-Za-z0-9_/])` admits a `/` preceded by `.`, `~` or `-`,
# so the TAIL of a RELATIVE path reads as an absolute one — `../../edn/README.md`
# came back as `/../edn/README.md`, `~/.claude/plugins/cache` as
# `/.claude/plugins/cache`. Those are the same reference, mis-cut.

# ── #2158 — WHAT "WILL NOT EXIST AFTER THE RUN" IS DERIVED FROM ─────────────
#
# TWO CANDIDATE DERIVATIONS WERE MEASURED, AND THE FIRST ONE FAILED. The
# obvious reading — "outside the project root and not on disk" — was
# implemented and censused over all 6847 published run roots on this host:
#
#     verdict rc 0 -> rc 1 : 2222 roots   (first draft, `_PATH_RE` lookbehind)
#     verdict rc 0 -> rc 1 : 1659 roots   (after the lookbehind fix above)
#
# and the surviving population was almost entirely two classes that are not
# lost evidence at all:
#
#   * SPEC PROSE. `/K/CS/CF/HD/SCR/JESDV/SUBCLASSV`, `/ARP/PMBus`, `/J/K`,
#     `/AIP/CLOSE/BREAK/DONE` — slash-separated field and signal alternatives
#     written by a protocol spec, in 55+ roots each. Nothing distinguishes them
#     from a pathname by shape.
#   * CONTAINER-INTERNAL TOOLCHAIN ROOTS. `/foss/pdks/...`, `/foss/designs/...`
#     — real, correct, still-mounted paths that simply are not on the HOST
#     filesystem the gate runs on. "Not on disk" is a statement about WHERE THE
#     GATE RAN, not about whether the run preserved anything, and using it as
#     the definition would make the gate's verdict depend on whether it was
#     invoked inside or outside the image.
#
# So existence is kept as a NECESSARY condition and is not sufficient. The
# derivation that actually comes from the RUN ROOT is this: the ephemeral
# location a run leaks is a COPY OF THE RUN ROOT ITSELF, somewhere else.
# `step_rtl_gen` stages the project as `<TMPDIR>/vibeic-rtl-step-XXXX/<name>`;
# every staging, snapshot and scratch shape in this flow has the same property,
# because that is what staging IS. A path that carries the run root's own
# directory name as one of its components, resolves OUTSIDE the run root, and
# is not on disk, is a reference to a relocated copy of this very project — and
# a reader following it gets nothing.
#
# `/foss/pdks/...` carries no such component, and neither does `/K/CS/CF/HD`;
# `/tmp/lane.rbsub6/vibeic-rtl-step-6k_pkx29/subservient` and
# `$HOME/_lane_x/stage/subservient/phase2/...` both do. The prefix is never
# consulted, which is the whole point of the issue.
#
# `_PATH_RE` IS DELIBERATELY NOT WIDENED. `collect_external_outputs.py` imports
# it (`_gate._PATH_RE`) to decide which LIVE artefacts to copy into the tree;
# widening it there would send that collector after `/usr/bin/...`. The new
# population gets its own expression, and the volatile-prefix behaviour — live
# and dangling alike — is byte-identical to before.

# A reference has to look like a FILESYSTEM path, not a slash-prefixed prose
# fragment: at least three parts (`/a/b`), and no empty or `..` component — the
# census also surfaced literal text like `/A//F`, which `Path.parts` silently
# normalizes into a plausible-looking three-component path.

    """The run-relative artefact `path_str` names, when it IS in the run root.

    A relocated-copy reference is only lost evidence when the evidence is
    actually gone. The same tree is often named through a SECOND MOUNT -- a run
    bind-mounted into the EDA container is both
    `/home/.../run20/phase3/...` on the host and `/foss/designs/run20/phase3/...`
    inside the image -- and a recorded command line naturally carries the
    container spelling. The artefact it names can be sitting in the run root the
    whole time.

    MEASURED on spm run20, `reports/phase3/die_finishing.json`, whose recorded
    KLayout `argv` carries both of these while the SAME record's `gds_in` gives
    the host spelling of the first:
        /foss/designs/run20/phase3/stage3/pnr/spm.gds         <- IS in the tree
        /foss/designs/run20/phase3/stage3/pnr/spm.sealed.gds  <- is NOT
    Both were reported as "an ephemeral location this run used and did not
    preserve". For the first that is false: the evidence is preserved, at the
    same run-relative path. run18L and run19 recorded the HOST spelling of the
    identical argv, so they were counted as in-tree self-references and this
    never showed -- the reference set changed because a PRODUCER changed, not
    because anything regressed.

    CORRECTED 2026-09-23 (R-0915-162), and the correction is the point of this
    paragraph. This docstring used to end by saying of `spm.sealed.gds` that it
    "keeps its finding, which is the honest answer: that output was never
    written, in any of the three runs". MEASURED on spm run23, that is FALSE:
    the seal ring succeeded (`state: PASS`, `generator_rc: 0`,
    `ring_check.verdict: PASS`) and the staging file was written and then
    PROMOTED onto `spm.gds` by `staged.replace(dest)` -- 102,923,002 bytes
    where the prefinish stream was 73,850,996. The file is absent because it
    was consumed, not because nothing was produced. A reader acting on the old
    sentence would have gone looking for a seal-ring failure that never
    happened. `consumed_into_verified` is how that case is now told apart, and
    it is told apart by the BYTES, not by the producer's word.

    The tail is derived from the run root's own directory NAME, exactly as
    `names_a_relocated_copy` derives condition (2); no prefix list is consulted.
    Returns the run-relative path when it exists in the run root, else None --
    so `spm.sealed.gds` keeps its finding, which is the honest answer: that
    output was never written, in any of the three runs.

    A volatile-looking absolute path is only an EXTERNAL-STORAGE finding when
    it points OUTSIDE the project being audited.  When the project root itself
    sits under a volatile prefix (`/tmp/...`, `/var/tmp/...`, `/dev/shm/...`,
    `/run/...`) every absolute self-reference the flow writes into its own
    `reports/**/*.json` matches `_PATH_RE` — so the gate reported the project's
    OWN in-tree files as artifacts that must be "copied into the project tree".

    That is self-inflating, because `flow_compliance_check` REGENERATES those
    gate JSONs (stamping the absolute project path into them) every time it
    runs: auditing a project from a scratch copy — the standard way to audit
    without mutating the original — manufactures the very violation being
    audited for, and the count grows with each audit run.

    Measured on a real run dir (spm x ihp-sg13g2), copied to /tmp and audited:
        before any audit run : 1 live external-storage artifact
        after ONE audit run  : 21 live, 13 gate JSONs now carrying the copy's
                               own absolute path
    The only variable between the two readings is that the audit ran.

    Sibling precedent: this file already carves out two non-violating classes
    the same way — R7 pinned plugin worktrees (`_pinned_plugin_root`) and #622
    log-sourced ephemeral tool paths. The project's own tree is the third, and

    # Over a project where none of
    # `_SCAN_GLOBS` matched, every list above is empty for the same reason a
    # genuinely clean project's lists are empty, and the two were collapsed
    # into one rc 0. `gate_zero_denominator_refuses_check` reported exactly
    # that (`ZERO_DENOMINATOR_EXITS_ZERO`), and its argument is the P0
    # umbrella's: the umbrella reads EXIT CODES, so the honesty already in the
    # prose ("0 file(s) scanned") never reached the verdict.
    #
    # WHY THIS GATE CANNOT TAKE THE `_ZERO_IS_A_PASS` ROUTE, which is the other
    # half of the finding and the half that must be argued rather than assumed.
    # For `professional_tb_check` the zero is a correct pass because the missing
    # input belongs to an OPTIONAL step: absence is a legitimate, expected state
    # the gate is not owed. Here it is the opposite. This gate's entire subject
    # is "the flow wrote its outputs somewhere other than the project tree", and
    # a project whose RESULT.md / waivers.json / reports/ / generated_docs are
    # ALL absent is the strongest possible symptom of that condition: if the
    # declaration files themselves were written to a scratch dir — the same
    # mistake this gate exists to catch, one level up — the canonical tree is
    # empty and the old rc 0 answered "no outputs outside the tree" for a
    # project whose every output is outside the tree. The gate cannot tell that
    # apart from "nothing has been produced yet", so it must not vouch for
    # either.
    #
    # IT IS A REFUSAL, NOT A FAILURE. rc 2 is the disclosed-skip convention;
    # `flow_compliance_check` classifies this message ZERO_DENOMINATOR, which is
    # NOT skip-eligible, so the P0 tier reads INCOMPLETE instead of PASS — the
    # gate stops contributing a green it never earned, and stops contributing a
    # red it cannot justify either.
    #
    # THE DETECTION SIDE IS UNTOUCHED: the refusal is keyed on `scanned == 0`
    # alone, so any project carrying even one declaration file still runs the

    # matter and that the run failed on it.
    #
    # THE CLASSIFICATION WAS NEVER DOUBLE. Reproduced on this tip (8HD-4, lane
    # cz2084, pinned image): the four non-blocking classes above — in-tree self
    # references, R7 pinned plugin sources, watchdog process markers, log-sourced
    # ephemeral tool paths — are each `continue`d before the finding is recorded,
    # so a marker CANNOT reach `nonlog` and CANNOT contribute to the exit code. A
    # project whose ONLY volatile references are two watchdog pidfiles exits 0.
    # What failed the run was a separate, genuinely blocking reference in the same
    # tree; the audit simply never said so.
    #
    # TWO REPORTING DEFECTS PRODUCED THAT, AND BOTH ARE FIXED HERE.
    #
    #   (1) THE DECIDING LINE WAS NOT FIRST. `flow_compliance_check._p0_first_line`
    #       records a failed gate's FIRST output line as its message, and the four
    #       non-blocking [INFO] disclosures were printed BEFORE the verdict line.
    #       Line 0 of a FAIL was therefore whichever disclosure happened to sort
    #       first — a note whose own text says "non-blocking". The gate is the half
    #       that must fix this: a reader taking the first line is taking the line a
    #       program is entitled to treat as the reason, so the reason has to BE
    #       first. Disclosures follow the verdict now, unchanged in wording.
    #
    #   (2) A DANGLING-ONLY FAILURE PRINTED NO FAILING LINE AT ALL. `live` empty +
    #       `dangling` non-empty exits 1 (it always has: `fail_count = len(live) +
    #       len(dangling)`), yet the only line the gate emitted for it was tagged
    #       `[WARN]`. So even a reader holding the FULL stdout was told the highest
    #       severity present was a warning, and handed a blocking exit code. The
    #       severity a gate prints must be the severity it exits with; a dangling
    #       reference is now stated as what it is — blocking, and worse than a live
    #       one, because the artefact is already gone and cannot be copied back.
    #
    # NEITHER HALF MOVES A VERDICT. Every exit code this function can return is
    # byte-identical to before; what changed is which sentence a reader — human or
    # `_p0_first_line` — gets when it asks WHY. chip-AGNOSTIC: pure classification

    # number the exit code is a function of — so a reader that takes only this
    # line still gets the reason and the size of it.
    # THE 200-CHARACTER BUDGET IS PART OF THE CONTRACT (#2084). `_p0_first_line`
    # publishes at most 200 characters of this line, and #2084 pins that the
    # WHOLE deciding sentence survives it — including at four-digit counts. The
    # first draft of the #2158 third term ("N dangling outside the run root")
    # pushed the 1024-reference case to 209 characters and truncated the
    # published reason mid-word; the term is spelled `outside-root` here and
    # written out in full in its own block below. Measured worst case, all three
    # counts four digits: 199 characters.
    # NAME THE FIRST REFERENCE ON THE REFUSAL LINE ITSELF -- WITHIN THE CAP.
    #
    # MEASURED on spm (lane icspm5, 2026-09-23). Step P0 recorded this gate's
    # refusal as the header alone: the path and its citing file are on the
    # lines BELOW, and the umbrella's reader (`flow_compliance_check.
    # _p0_first_line`) keeps exactly one line. The volatile path was swept
    # minutes later, the gate then exited 0, and the occurrence became
    # unattributable.
    #
    # AND THE CAP IS NOT NEGOTIABLE. `_p0_first_line` truncates at 200 chars
    # and #2084 exists because a line cut mid-sentence is how
    # `testbench_exists_check` came to publish `"{"`. My first version simply
    # appended the reference and pushed the line to 267 -- it made the refusal
    # attributable by breaking the rule that makes it publishable at all.
    #
    # So the reference is fitted to what is LEFT, and the sentence still ends
    # in the colon the contract requires. When even an elided reference will
    # not fit -- four-digit counts leave almost nothing -- the header is
    # exactly what it was, and the detail blocks below still carry the path in
    # full. The cap wins; attribution takes the room the cap leaves.
