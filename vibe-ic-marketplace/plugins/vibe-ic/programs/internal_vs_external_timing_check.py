internal_vs_external_timing_check.py — L8 must separate host-side from DUT-side timing.

Problem statement (chip-AGNOSTIC):
  Half-duplex single-wire protocols measure timing at TWO distinct places:
    - HOST->DUT (external): how long the HOST drives low to send symbols
                           (e.g. logic-0, logic-1, break) to the DUT.
    - DUT->HOST (internal): how long the DUT should drive low when
                           responding back to the HOST.
  These two sets of values are NOT equal. Tolerance windows differ, the
  inter-byte time (IBT) is almost always different, and the DUT-side
  values are what the RTL TX state machine must use to drive the bus.

Failure mode caught by this gate:
  When L8_TIMING_WAVEFORM lists only host-side measurements, the
  Phase 2 RTL generator is forced to pick ONE set of numbers and will
  reuse the host-side values on the DUT side. If the host IBT is larger
  than the BR (break) threshold the tester uses, the tester interprets
  every inter-byte gap as a packet-end BR and truncates every response
  to zero usable bytes. End result: connect_test fails on every cycle.

  A gold reference L8 (hardware-PASSed) has both sets:
    rx_counters_at_2p5MHz  : {H1_low [1,9], H0_low [10,30], BR_low [31,65]}
    tx_cycles_at_5MHz      : {H1_low 9, H1_high 41, H0_low 35, H0_high 15,
                              BR_low 69, BR_high 18, IBT_high 60}
  The bad L8 has only the equivalent of the FIRST set (host-side), so this
  gate would have flagged it at generation time.

Rule enforced
-------------
For any protocol layer that does BOTH RX and TX on a shared wire, the
L8_TIMING_WAVEFORM document MUST carry TWO clearly-named groups:
  - An "rx_*" / "host_side_*" / "external_*" group: host-drive widths
    the DUT's RX decoder must tolerate.
  - A "tx_*" / "dut_side_*" / "internal_*" group: widths the DUT's TX
    encoder drives on the wire.
Both groups must cover the same symbol set (H0, H1, BR, IBT minimum).

Additionally, the DUT-side IBT **must** be strictly less than the
RX-side BR minimum threshold (otherwise the far side — which uses the
same RX spec — will misclassify IBT as a packet-end BR, which is the
exact v068 failure mode).

Usage
-----
    internal_vs_external_timing_check.py <L8_TIMING_WAVEFORM.json>
        [--layer L8_RTL_CONSTANTS.json]
        [--json]

If L8_RTL_CONSTANTS is provided, the IBT<BR cross-check also runs
against its numeric values (after unit normalisation to μs).

Exit codes
----------
    0 = both timing groups present with required symbols; IBT < BR
    1 = group missing, symbol missing, or IBT≥BR inversion
    2 = IO / JSON parse error
