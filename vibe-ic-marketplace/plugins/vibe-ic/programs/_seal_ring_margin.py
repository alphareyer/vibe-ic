"""_seal_ring_margin — how far a DIE's core must stay back from the die edge on
a technology that ships its own seal ring.  vibe-ic#2122

THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR (measured, vibeic-eda#189 / vibe-ic#2122)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
On a `deliverable=DIE` run the flow sized the die to the core and then sealed
the ring onto it IN PLACE. The ring is a band at the die edge and the deck
requires a clearance between its marker and every prime-die layer, so a core
that reaches the die edge is inside both. Measured on one gf180mcuD die:

    ring alone, 503 um die                                    16, all density
    the run's own core (filling 0,0;503,503) + that ring    1,359,531
    the same core moved 28.5 um inward, 560 um die                    0

19,826 core shapes sat inside the 16 um ring band. The ring was correct, the
generator was correct and the deck was correct; the DIE was too small by
exactly the band plus the deck's own clearance, on every edge.

WHAT THIS MODULE IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT
---------------------------------------
It is the ONE derivation of that margin, read out of the TECHNOLOGY, for the
two places that need it — `phase3_one_shot_runner.step_pnr`, which sizes the
die before the ring exists, and `die_finishing_gen`, which must refuse to seal
a core that reaches into the band. It carries NO number of its own:

    band       the seal-ring generator's OWN cell library says how deep its
               edge is (`<something>_width`, discovered by name, never a
               literal here) — or, better where it exists, the MEASURED inner
               extent of the ring the generator actually built
               (`sealring_verify.ring_extent`), which is a measurement of this
               die and not a reading of a parameter.
    clearance  the PDK's own DRC deck, in its own words: the separation every
               prime-die layer owes the guard-ring marker
               (`<layer>.separation(<guard-ring marker>, N.um)`).

EVERY UNREADABLE LINK IS A NAMED `NOT_MEASURED`, never a default. A margin
this module invented would be this flow deciding where the foundry's ring
goes, which is the whole defect one level up.

chip/PDK-AGNOSTIC: no foundry, node, PDK name, layer number or design name
appears here. The layer VARIABLES are discovered from the deck's own text by
what they are (a guard-ring marker), not by what they are called in any one
process.
