"""area_signoff_baseline.py — resolve the sign-off value a design declares FOR
THE TECHNOLOGY THIS RUN BUILDS AGAINST, or refuse by name.

TWO METRICS, ONE LADDER (vibe-ic#2147). The same L7 table that states a
standard-cell AREA ceiling states a TOTAL POWER ceiling in the identical shape
and from the identical technology-bound baseline, so it goes through the
identical ladder rather than through a second reader that would answer
differently (measured in this repo: a second copy of "the same fact" answers
differently). The metric is a parameter; everything else here is shared.

CHIP_AGNOSTIC: strict — no process, vendor or PDK name anywhere in this file,
DOCSTRING INCLUDED. This is STRICTER than the repo-wide
`source_chip_agnostic_check`, which permits open-PDK names; that gate's PASS is
not this file's verdict.
`test_issue2136_area_signoff_baseline::test_the_program_names_no_process_or_vendor_token`
is, and it reads the WHOLE file. The rule is DECLARED HERE and not only in that
test because an author editing this file has to be able to see it — measured:
the ban shipped asserted-but-undeclared and
`test_chip_agnostic_strictness_is_declared_not_hidden` reddened on exactly that,
which is the rule working.

THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES (measured, vibe-ic#2136)
==============================================
An L7 verification plan states a baseline it MEASURED, and then turns that
measurement into an absolute sign-off row::

    ### 7.4.1 Baseline (top=..., <library-A>, TT corner)
    | stdcell area | **12,775 um^2** |

    ### 7.4.2 Sign-off Acceptance Range
    | stdcell area | (0, baseline x 1.3] = <= 16,608 um^2 | gate |

The baseline row is ATTRIBUTED — it names the standard-cell library it was
measured on.  The sign-off row is not: it carries only the product.  A reader
of the sign-off row alone sees an absolute area ceiling that looks like a
property of the DESIGN, and it is a property of ONE TECHNOLOGY.

Measured consequence: a run of the same design on a different, physically
larger open technology mapped to 57,024.71 um^2 (2180 cells).  Against the row
that is a 3.4x overshoot; against the row's own denominator it is not a
comparison at all, because that denominator was never measured on the library
this run used.  The lane declined to report pass/fail and said so, which is the
correct human answer and exactly the answer a program has to be able to give.

This is the same shape as ``database_unit_um`` (#2085) and as the clock period
(#2091): a TECHNOLOGY fact stated once, for one technology, and then read as if
it were universal.  `clock_target_provenance` is the model followed here — the
value never travels without the tier that produced it.

WHAT THIS PROGRAM DOES
======================
It reads the design INPUT for (a) a declared standard-cell area baseline and
its attribution, and (b) the acceptance rule applied to it, and answers ONE
question: *is there a valid denominator for the technology this run resolved?*

THE LADDER, highest authority first::

    declared_pdk_table              a technology-keyed area table row matching
                                    this run's library / PDK
    declared_baseline_technology    a baseline row whose own attribution names
                                    this run's technology family
    derived_reference_netlist       a reference-netlist area MEASURED in this
                                    run's own cell library, x the declared ratio
    not_determined                  NAMED REFUSAL                <-- never PASS

``NOT_DETERMINED`` IS THE LOAD-BEARING STATE.  It is not a soft PASS and it is
not a FAIL: a design measured against a denominator from another technology has
not been judged at all, and publishing either verdict would be a false
statement about the design.  Every refusal carries `reason`, the run's
technology, and the attribution text the document actually carried, so the
refusal is actionable rather than merely negative.

WHY THE BASELINE'S ATTRIBUTION GOVERNS THE THRESHOLD
====================================================
The absolute in the acceptance row is a PRODUCT of the baseline and a ratio the
same document states.  It inherits the baseline's attribution and has none of
its own.  So a threshold is usable exactly when the baseline behind it is, and
a document that states an absolute with no attributable baseline anywhere
declares no denominator at all.

HONESTY BOUNDARY (Sec 4.05)
===========================
Only the design INPUT is read.  Nothing is defaulted, interpolated, rounded or
scaled from a neighbouring technology.  Two baseline rows that match the run
and DISAGREE are AMBIGUOUS and resolve to nothing — picking one by document
order is how a cross-technology number gets published as a specification.  A
denied row is not a declaration (vibe-ic#712), consulted through the repo's one
negation vocabulary.

HOW THE STRICT DECLARATION ABOVE IS HONOURED: the run's technology names are
supplied by the CALLER from what the run resolved, and every other name comes
from the design's own document.  Two names belong to the same technology family
when one's leading family token is a prefix of the other's — a naming
convention, not a name.
