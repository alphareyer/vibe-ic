"""perc_corpus_sweep.py — run the v0.2.4-2.11 PERC-equivalent sign-off chain across a CORPUS
of already-routed designs, deterministically, with NO container needed.

ROLE: producer/classifier

Issue #1980 moved this sweep out of the gate denominator. The Step-31 output
record retains WELLTAP_GAP / cross-domain INCOMPLETE findings; the separate
`sweep_reach_check` program owns the refusal predicate.
Captured v0.2.12 from the 2026-06-01 Shape-A 21-IC benchmark_ic sweep
(benchmark_ic/RESULT_PERC_CORPUS_v0211.md): that sweep was driven by an ad-hoc /tmp script.
This promotes it to a first-class, tested plugin capability so any corpus PERC sweep is one
command — `python3 perc_corpus_sweep.py <dir1> [<dir2> ...]` — instead of a throwaway.

For each design directory it finds the most-routed DEF (prefers `*routed*` > `chip_top` >
`post_hold`) under `<dir>/phase3/**` and runs the SHIPPED pure structural checks from
`phase3_one_shot_runner.py` (imported, NOT re-implemented):
  - well-tap presence (latch-up)         → _welltap_presence_check
  - ESD pad-ring presence                → _esd_pad_ring_presence
  - ESD discharge-path topology          → _esd_discharge_topology (only if a pad ring exists)
  - cross-voltage-domain                 → _xdomain_levelshifter_check

HONESTY (inherited from the checks): these are open-source STRUCTURAL screens, NOT a commercial
PERC run. A WELLTAP_GAP / XDOMAIN_GAP is a conclusive structural exposure; PRESENT/OK results are
NECESSARY-BUT-NOT-SUFFICIENT (device-physics stays MANUAL). A corpus-wide GAP is NOT proof of a
current-runner bug — validate against a FRESH same-version control before triaging (the
stale-artifact lesson from the v0.2.11 sweep, where 14/14 0-tap were pre-tapcell-fix DEFs).

ARTIFACT-VINTAGE GUARD (suggested_fix #4 of ORGANIC-20260601-...-stale-pre-tapcell-fix):
each sweep also runs `artifact_vintage_guard`, which WARNs when a routed DEF with > N std
cells has 0 valid taps AND an older/sibling DEF in the same lineage is ALSO 0-tap — the
structural signature of a STALE pre-tapcell-fix artifact (the whole lineage never ran the
tapcell step), as opposed to a LIVE current-runner regression. It never fails a build; it is
a triage WARN so a corpus PERC number is not mis-cited as a current-quality signal.

REACH (v1.9.79+): a corpus sweep whose targets carry no routed DEF used to print a table of
`no routed DEF` rows and exit 0 — the same exit code, to every automated consumer, as a sweep
that ran the PERC chain on every IC and found nothing wrong. It now accounts for how many
targets actually entered `sweep_one` (`_sweep_reach.SweepReach`) and routes rc 2 +
`VACUOUS_PASS:` through the shipped `_vacuous_exit` convention when that count is ZERO. A
PARTIAL sweep still exits 0: most corpora contain core macros and pre-layout blocks the chain
genuinely cannot reach, and failing those would be a worse defect than the silence it replaces.
