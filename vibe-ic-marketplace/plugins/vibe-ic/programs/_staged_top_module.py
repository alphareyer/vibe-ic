"""Which module in a REUSED-IP design's STAGED RTL is the one its documents
describe — and what does that module actually declare?

WHY THIS EXISTS
===============
Phase 1 reads ``input/docs/`` only. For a design whose input STAGES the
implementation (``input/vendor_rtl/``), the documents state the port NAMES and
the RTL states what those ports ARE. Neither alone is the answer, and Phase 1
was only ever asking one of them.

MEASURED on ``opentitan_aes`` (2026-09-02, plugin v1.15.50). The staged
``aes.sv`` declares 14 ports. ``L9_INTEGRATION_SPEC.json`` published 9 entries,
of which 7 were real ports and 2 (``tl`` / ``edn``) were Comportable
inter-signal BASE names the doc's own table lists, not ports at all. Missing
entirely: ``rst_ni``, ``rst_shadowed_ni``, ``rst_edn_ni``, ``tl_i``, ``tl_o``,
``alert_rx_i``, ``alert_tx_o`` — both resets and both alert ports. Downstream,
``professional_tb_gen`` emitted ``RST = None`` and a reset routine that does
nothing, and ``full_stack_tb_gen`` declared ``reg tl_i = 0;`` for a
100-plus-bit ``tlul_pkg::tl_h2d_t`` struct.

The doc-side width loss has one mechanism, and it is not a bug in the walker:
the Comportable *Inter-Module Signals* table's ``Width`` column means "one
instance of the struct", so ``| tl | tlul_pkg::tl | req_rsp | rsp | 1 |``
correctly reads as ``1`` — of a struct whose name the walker discards because
no L-doc field could hold it. A port's declared TYPE had nowhere to go.

HOW THE TOP MODULE IS CHOSEN — and why not the two obvious ways
===============================================================
Both structural shortcuts were measured on the corpus and both are WRONG:

  * *"the module nobody instantiates"* — over the staged aes tree that is 136
    of 243 modules, and ``aes`` is not among them (``aes_wrap`` instantiates
    it).
  * *"the module with the largest instantiation closure"* — that is
    ``aes_wrap`` (38 vs ``aes``'s 36), whose own first comment line reads
    "AES wrapper for FI experiments". A fault-injection harness is not the
    design, and publishing its ports (``aes_input`` / ``aes_key`` /
    ``test_done_o``) as the design's would be a fabricated interface.

The rule used instead is a RECONCILIATION, which is what the situation
actually is: the design's DOCUMENTS name the ports, so the staged module the
documents describe is the one that DECLARES those names. Score every staged
module by how many of the document-derived port names it declares; take the
strict unique maximum, and require at least ``MIN_NAME_OVERLAP`` of them.

Measured on the same tree: ``aes`` 7, ``prim_edn_req`` 4, ``aes_core`` 3,
``aes_wrap`` 1. On ibex: ``ibex_core`` 12, next 2.

FAIL-CLOSED IN EVERY DIRECTION. No staged RTL, no document-derived names, a
tie for the maximum, or an overlap below the floor → ``None``, and the caller
enriches nothing. A design we could not identify the top of earns no
statement about its interface.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT ASSERTED
===========================
This module reports what the RTL DECLARES. It does not resolve a struct's
width (``tlul_pkg::tl_h2d_t`` is a type name, not a number) and it does not
elaborate a parameterised range (``[NumAlerts-1:0]`` comes back as the
expression, with ``width`` unresolved). A consumer that needs a number must
say so; a consumer that needs to know the port is not a scalar now can.
