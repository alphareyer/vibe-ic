"""_step_verdict_table.py — the ONE reader that turns a compliance artefact into
a per-step verdict TABLE, and the ONE differ that says which way a step moved.

CHIP_AGNOSTIC: strict-logic — the LOGIC below reads two JSON documents; the ICs
appear only in this docstring, as the evidence for the rules.

WHY THIS EXISTS (OWNER RULING R-0915-86 (1), 2026-09-16)
========================================================
3,713 test files; 173 invoke a real EDA tool; NONE runs an IC end-to-end. The
flow-matrix suite checks that steps have gates WIRED — 45 of 61 cells in one
dimension are stand-ins. Every rule bug found on 2026-09-16 surfaced only when a
REAL run reached a later step: the r26 `stage_on_pass_review` cascade, run16's
INCONCLUSIVE booked as SKIP, the DRV census taken with no parasitics in STA.

So a landing gate has to answer one question about a REAL IC: *did this change
move any step's verdict, and in which direction?* Two programs ask it —
`real_ic_gate` (run the front door on a live checkout) and `audit_replay`
(re-judge a frozen snapshot with the current tree's programs). This module is
the half they share, so there is ONE table shape and ONE direction rule rather
than two that drift. R-0915-85 ("不要設計的疊床架屋"): a second copy of a rule is
the layering the owner banned, and a rule nobody can find is the rule everybody
re-invents.

TWO ARTEFACTS, ONE TABLE — MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED
================================================
`flow_compliance_check` writes the same table under two key names:

    reports/audit/phase23_completion_audit.json   `verdict`  `step_counts`  `command_argv`
    the path given to --json                      `overall`  `counts`       (no argv)

MEASURED 2026-09-16 on `/home/reyerchu/_frozen/subservient_r26`: one invocation
with `--json` and one without produced `steps[]` lists that are element-for-
element identical (69 steps, identical 18-key step records, identical counts);
only the two top-level key names differ. A reader that knew one shape would read
the other as a table with no verdict, so this one accepts either and says which
it found.

THE DIRECTION RULE IS DERIVED, NOT ENUMERATED
=============================================
`programs/verdict.py` is "the ONE place a flow verdict word is classified"
(R-0915-85 reduced the vocabulary to five AT THE PRODUCERS and folded
`_flow_verdict_tiers` into it). This module therefore adds NO vocabulary. It
ranks a word with that module's own predicates:

    3 FULL_PASS       `is_full_pass`      the only word that satisfies a
                                          predecessor outright
    2 QUALIFIED_DONE  `is_qualified_done` ran, did not fail, measured/certified
                                          less than a full pass
    1 EXCUSED         `is_excused`        exactly what the producer SUBTRACTS
                                          from `total_required` — it did not run
    0 NON_GREEN       `is_non_green`      the producer's failing/missing buckets

A rank DECREASE is a REGRESSION, an INCREASE an IMPROVEMENT, and a word change
at the same rank a LATERAL (a rename or a re-classification that moves nothing).
The lateral tier is not decoration: R-0915-85 is reducing 23 verdict words to 5
AT THE PRODUCERS, and the whole point of this gate during that reform is to tell
a rename apart from a judgement change. A rename that is NOT lateral — say
`SKIPPED-CONDITION` (EXCUSED, rank 1) re-spelled to a word registered nowhere
(a done-claim by subtraction, rank 2) — shows up here as 27 IMPROVEMENTS on SPM,
which is exactly the signal that the new word owes `_flow_verdict_tiers` a home.
That is the anti-drift device working, not a false alarm to be papered over.

EXCUSED RANKS BELOW QUALIFIED-DONE ON PURPOSE. `PASS -> SKIPPED-CONDITION` is the
SKIP laundering R-0915-85 names in its own text ("today's cascade and the SKIP
laundering"): a step that used to run and pass, now not run at all. Ranking
"not run" above "ran and measured little" would make laundering the cheapest way
to green a table, which is the incentive inversion `_flow_verdict_tiers` was
written to delete.

TWO TABLES ARE COMPARABLE ONLY IF THE SAME EXPERIMENT PRODUCED THEM
===================================================================
There are TWO ways two tables can be answers to different questions, and this
module refuses on both. The second one was found BY USING THIS GATE, on its very
first real run, and it cost a wrong headline.

  1. THE INSTRUMENT'S SCOPE — `command_argv`. See the section below.

  2. THE RUN SHAPE — did an AGENT answer the flow's hand-offs, or did a program
     run alone? The flow is program-first + AI-BACKUP: several steps complete by
     handing work to an agent and consuming its answer. `flow_compliance_check`
     names that state itself, in `_AWAITING_EXIT_CODE`'s own comment: *"pass one
     completed and pass two is somebody else's move … a PROGRAM cannot spawn the
     subagent pass two needs."*

     MEASURED 2026-09-16 (R-0915-88), SPM, the published cell
     `ic/spm/v1.21.6_gf180mcuD` versus a program-only run of the same input:

         D1  phase1_expert_parse_track --check-report   cell rc 0 PASS   /  program-only rc 4 INCOMPLETE
         5   formal_proof_evidence_check                cell PASS        /  program-only FAIL

     and the SAME split at SIX trees spanning `845ef5247..a8d39cb70` plus current
     main — the tree never moved either verdict. The cell's own artefacts say why:
     `expert_parse_track.json` records `ai_subtrack.status=CONSUMED,
     observed_ai_consumed=6`, and `phase2/stage1/formal/formal_expert_review.json`
     records `invocation_status=INVOKED, invoked_by="lane icspm3 (formal-verify
     expert role)"` with 5 hand-authored properties. A landing gate runs the front
     door with no agent attached, so it CANNOT reproduce either — and diffing the
     two tables reported "SPM regressed" about a landing that had done nothing.

     `run_shape` is DERIVED, never declared by the reader and never a per-step
     exception list: the run's own `gate_execution_ledger` already records every
     gate's `exit_code`, and the set of gates that exited AWAITING is the set of
     second passes nobody answered. A tier invented tomorrow inherits this for
     free, because the constant is imported from the module that defines it.

     THE LIMIT, STATED. Root (b) above leaves NO awaiting row — its gate exits 1
     like any other failure — so on these two runs it is caught only because D1's
     awaiting row refuses the whole table. A future run whose ONLY difference is
     a (b)-shaped one would still diff. That is the honest bound of a derived
     signal, and the remedy is the one this module already recommends for the
     replay: make the reference a prior run of the SAME gate, where the shape is
     equal by construction.

COMPARABILITY IS CHECKED BEFORE ANY DIFF IS PRINTED
===================================================
MEASURED 2026-09-16, and the reason this section exists: the LAST compliance
invocation of a run overwrites `reports/audit/phase23_completion_audit.json`, so
a stage-scoped invocation replaces the full table with its own. On the two frozen
snapshots the orchestrator supplied:

    /home/reyerchu/_frozen/subservient_r26      9 steps, argv stage4_compliance.py . --exclude-step 39
    /home/reyerchu/_frozen/sha256_run16_pass2   9 steps, argv flow_compliance_check.py ... --stage-id stage_analog

while a full `--strict` pass over the same trees yields 69. Diffing 69 against 9
would report 60 REMOVED steps and read as a catastrophic regression; it is an
instrument answering about a different subject. So `diff_tables` REFUSES
(`comparable=False`) unless both tables name the same program and the same
scoping flags, and the caller exits 2 — a refusal, never a pass and never a
"regression" it cannot support.
