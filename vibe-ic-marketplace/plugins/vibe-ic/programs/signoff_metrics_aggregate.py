"""signoff_metrics_aggregate.py — write the sign-off metrics THIS flow measured.

ENFORCEMENT: blocking

The declaration is TRUE of this program and of how it is wired, and both halves
had to be made true together. Step 37.4's gate clause is a plain
``program_exit_zero``, so the flow blocks on ``--check``; but until
``phase3_one_shot_runner.step_signoff_metrics_aggregate`` existed, NO runner
spawned this program at all, so its verdict could not stop the step it guards
and `flow_gate_enforcement_audit` classified it AUDIT_ONLY. Declaring
``blocking`` over that wiring would have been a contradiction — the exact shape
that register refuses. The runner now spawns it inline and branches on the
status, so the claim above is one the audit can check rather than one it has to
take on trust.

WHY THIS PROGRAM EXISTS
=======================
Four programs read ``phase3/final/metrics.json`` and NOTHING wrote it. Measured
at v1.16.2 over the whole worktree::

    grep -rn "final/metrics.json"  ->  5 readers, 0 writers
      tapeout_docs_gen.py:392   ic_release_docs_gen.py:146
      _ic_release_artefacts.py:12   release_docs_check.py:851
      flow/phase1_phase2_phase3.yaml (a comment)

``phase3/final/`` was not even a directory ``_path_layout`` defined; no run tree
and no published benchmark-data cell contains one. The 18 keys those readers
want are OpenLane-2 / LibreLane metric names, and this flow drives OpenROAD,
magic, netgen, KLayout and OpenSTA DIRECTLY -- it never runs LibreLane's Classic
flow, which is the thing that would have written that file. So step 37.5ic could
not produce ONE of its six document outputs for ANY design: not spm, not sha256,
not aes. Completing a route does not change that, because the missing artefact is
not a layout, it is the summary of the checks that were run ON the layout.

Every number those 18 keys ask for is ALREADY on the tree, in the per-checker
report the checker itself wrote. This program is the aggregator over exactly
those reports, and nothing else. It measures nothing itself and re-decides
nothing: it reads a verdict a checker already recorded and copies it under the
name the document generators read.

THE THREE RULES THIS PROGRAM IS BUILT ON
========================================
1.  **A key whose source is absent is NOT_MEASURED, with the reason, and it is
    still WRITTEN.** Never a default, never omitted. A downstream reader must be
    able to tell "measured 0" from "nobody looked"; those two are the difference
    between a clean sign-off and a document that launders an empty run
    (`_ic_release_artefacts` exists because that exact laundering was measured).
    Omitting the key is the same lie by another route: `tapeout_docs_gen.g`
    returns NOT_MEASURED for an absent key too, so a reader cannot distinguish
    "this run had no antenna report" from "this aggregator has no rule for
    antenna". Written-with-a-reason can be distinguished; absent cannot.

2.  **Every key carries provenance**: the project-relative source path and its
    sha256, in ``__provenance__`` inside the metrics file and in full in
    ``reports/phase3/signoff_metrics_aggregate.json``. A number in a datasheet
    whose report nobody can name is a number nobody can check.

3.  **Attribution is READ, never guessed from a filename.** The DRC keys are
    per-TOOL (`magic__`, `klayout__`, `route__`) and this flow's DRC audit
    records the tool in ``summary.producers[].producer``. A filename is a
    convention; the producer field is the audit's own measurement. Never bridge
    one tool's count to another tool's key -- the router reporting 0 while the
    KLayout sign-off deck reports 2 real violations is a MEASURED state of this
    flow, and renaming one into the other is how it disappears.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
===================
* It does not decide whether the design is releasable. ``release_blockers``
  in `tapeout_docs_gen` owns that verdict and this program never anticipates it:
  a run with dirty metrics gets a metrics file stating exactly how dirty.
* It does not re-run or re-judge any checker. If two checkers disagree, both
  are reported under their own keys and the disagreement stays visible.
* It does not fail the run. Exit 0 with the file written is the answer for a
  tree with no reports at all -- every key NOT_MEASURED with the reason. Exit 2
  is reserved for a project directory that does not exist.

    WHY NOT `reports/spare_preservation.json`, WHICH IS THE BETTER FACT

    what SURVIVED into the shipped netlist/DEF/GDS — an inserted spare a later
    pass removed reaches nothing — and `spare_preservation.json` carries
    exactly that. Reading it here is refused, and the flow says so in its own
    words at step 34:

        "`reports/spare_preservation.json` IS NOT DECLARED HERE … this step's
         only producer of that file is the `optional_program_exit_zero` clause
         below, which runs only when `phase3/stage3/pnr/spare_cells.json` is
         present, while `required_outputs` is UNCONDITIONAL … Declaring it
         asserts a production the same gate denies four lines down, and reds
         every spare-less design over an artefact nobody owes."

    and at step 37.5ic, about a consumer that was wired and then REMOVED for
    this very reason:

        "WHAT WOULD MAKE IT WIREABLE: a step that produces
         `reports/spare_preservation.json` UNCONDITIONALLY and declares it. As
         long as step 34's producer is conditional, no honest declaration
         exists and no gate may read the path."

    I re-created that consumer and d7 caught it — `W2:produced_consumed_
    undeclared` on step 37.4 — which is the register working. So this reads
    `reports/spare_cell_coverage.json` instead: step 18 DECLARES it in
    `required_outputs`, and `spare_cell_coverage_check` is its sole declaring
    producer (docs/decisions/2026-08-22-spare-cell-coverage-declaring-producer).

    AND THE BASIS SAYS WHAT THE WEAKER FACT IS. This is the pool at insertion,
    graded for density / distribution / tie-off — NOT a survival count. The key
    must not be read as evidence that the pool reached the shipped artefacts;
    `spare_cell_preservation_check` is what answers that, and it cannot be
    consumed here until its producer is unconditional and declared.

#: Keys this aggregator publishes for the AXIS gate, not for the release
#: documents (2026-09-15, icspm2).
#:
#: `test_every_key_the_release_readers_read_has_a_rule` pins RULES against the
#: key set `tapeout_docs_gen` reads, as an EQUALITY. Its stated intent is
#: one-directional — "a key added there and not here would silently be
#: NOT_MEASURED forever" — and that direction is untouched and still exact.
#: What the equality ALSO said, incidentally, is that this aggregator may never
#: publish a measurement the release documents do not print, and that is the
#: half these six keys break: `every_required_metric_key_has_a_producer` is a
#: SECOND consumer, and it reported six axes as "NOT PROVEN BY ANY RUN IN THIS
#: CORPUS" over runs that had measured every one of them.
#:
#: So the closure property is kept rather than relaxed: RULES is still exactly
#: `readers | AXIS_ONLY_KEYS`, and a key may still not appear in RULES without
#: being accounted for HERE, in writing, with the consumer that wants it named.
