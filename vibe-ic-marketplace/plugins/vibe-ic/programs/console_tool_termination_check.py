"""console_tool_termination_check.py — an EDA tool that can drop into its own
text console must be stopped by something that TRAVELS WITH THE COMMAND.

WHY (measured 2026-09-09 in the shipped image, after a 102 GB log was found)
==========================================================================
`netgen` and `magic` both carry an interactive text console. Reaching it is
not the bug; what makes it a disk-filling runaway is that the console
re-prints its whole menu for every byte of stdin it cannot parse. Measured
throughput in `ghcr.io/vibeic/vibeic-eda`, stdin fed unparseable bytes:

    netgen, no -batch                       9.9 MB / 5 s
    magic -dnull -noconsole, script w/o quit  4.0 MB / 6 s

At 2 MB/s that is ~170 GB/day. A run left on 2026-08-12 wrote a single
`pos.out.log` of 102 GB -- 1,619,420,055 lines, of which the last 2000 held
NINE distinct lines.

WHAT ACTUALLY STOPS IT, AND WHAT ONLY LOOKS LIKE IT DOES
--------------------------------------------------------
Two independent properties each suffice, and they are NOT equally durable:

* stdin at EOF. Measured safe for both tools. But this is a property of the
  CALLER's argv -- here, that `_container_exec.docker_exec_argv` builds
  `docker exec` WITHOUT `-i`. Anyone adding `-i` for an unrelated reason, in
  a different file, re-arms every call site at once.
* the command's own terminator. `netgen -batch` (measured: holds even when
  the sourced Tcl errors and when the arguments are wrong) and a magic script
  ending in `quit`. This travels with the command and cannot be undone
  elsewhere.

This program requires the second. It does not forbid the first; it refuses to
let the first be the ONLY thing standing between a tool and the disk.

WHAT IT CHECKS
--------------
Command strings are read from the arguments of the shipped execution helpers
(`_docker_exec`, `_docker_exec_raw`, `_sh`, `_run`, `_exec`,
`run_in_container`), located with `ast` -- never by grepping the file. That
distinction is the whole reason this is trustworthy: `analog_hardmacro_gds_emit`
carries the string

    f"magic -rcfile {magicrc} {tcl_name} returned "

inside a `detail=` FAILURE MESSAGE. A text scan flags it; reading the call
graph does not, because nothing executes it.

* `netgen ...`   must contain `-batch`.
* `klayout ...`  must contain `-b` (measured clean; `-zz -b` also passes).
* `magic ...`    runs a script, so the flag cannot settle it. The module that
  builds that script must emit a terminal `quit`. Checked per-module, which
  is the granularity the evidence supports.

WHY_NOT_BUCKET_A: whether a given Tcl string is "the script this magic call
runs" needs the data flow between a builder, a staging call and an exec call,
across modules. The deterministic half -- a module that executes magic must
also emit a `quit` -- is what this measures.
