"""librelane_cts_hold.py — steps 19 (CTS) and 20 (post-CTS hold repair) on LibreLane (T98).

Selected by `phase3/librelane_switch.json` (`"19"`/`"20"`: `librelane` or
`dual`, both the same) through `librelane_contract.selected_mode`. With both
`direct` (switch absent, or naming other steps) `phase3_one_shot_runner` runs
its single PnR session exactly as before and nothing here is called.

Otherwise one PnR approach is split at the deck's step-19/20 region
(`_PNR_CTS_HOLD_BEGIN`..`_PNR_CTS_HOLD_END`, emitted by the runner's deck
builder): the direct deck runs up to the region and checkpoints; the
checkpoint is bridged into LibreLane `OpenROAD.CTS` ->
`Vibeic.ClockPathDriveSizing` (#2160, a plugin step, `librelane_plugins/`) ->
`OpenROAD.ResizerTimingPostCTS`, then `OpenROAD.STAMidPNR` once per STA corner;
the selected views are handed to the paths the direct route reads, and the
deck resumes from the handed-over ODB after the region.

Every function that needs the runner's own machinery (its docker dispatch,
its deck surgery, its restore-time session state) takes the runner MODULE as
`R`: this module never imports the runner, because the runner is usually
`__main__` and importing it by name would load a second copy whose patched
names nobody reads.

chip-AGNOSTIC: no design, PDK, corner or cell literal. Every LibreLane config
value carries its declared source (MIGRATION_COMMON `librelane_config`).
