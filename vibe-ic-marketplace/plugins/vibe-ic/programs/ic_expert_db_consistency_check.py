"""ic_expert_db_consistency_check.py — gate: the IC Expert DB stays an ADVISORY
knowledge layer that is CONSISTENT with (never contradicts) the deterministic
gate/program layer, and is blindness-clean.

The IC Expert DB feeds the general Vibe-IC authoring path with design-craft
knowledge. It must NOT:
  1. contain a benchmark/design IDENTIFIER (blindness — no `cvdp_*`, `Prob\\d+`,
     `circuit\\d+` design→solution association leaking into the author digest);
  2. assert an oracle-VALUE bound to a named design (e.g. "design X expects 0xF2");
  3. claim to BE / OVERRIDE a deterministic gate (a lesson is ADVICE, not a hard
     rule the flow enforces — it must never say "the gate must accept", "disable
     the check", "skip lint", "ignore the conformance gate", etc.);
  4. instruct sourcing a name/value from a hidden-scorer artifact (§4.05
     ORACLE-SOURCE ban, issue #139 adjudication 2026-07-14): the scorer-side
     `.env` (its TOPLEVEL / VERILOG_SOURCES variables), "harness metadata", or
     the golden `output.*` are the oracle — a lesson keyed on them is only
     actionable via a forbidden oracle read, so it can never be honest general
     experience. Lessons MAY still describe how a hidden checker BINDS/samples
     the design (craft about the observable contract); they may not name the
     oracle files/variables as an INPUT to the authoring decision.

SCANNED SURFACES (#2143). The four families above are applied to `entries[]`
lessons AND to every text field of `registered_class_profiles.*`. The second
surface is not decoration: a class profile's `integration_contract` prose is
written verbatim into the `contract.md` that `ic_expert_backup_pack` hands the
IC Expert Agent, so it is the same §4.05 channel a lesson is, reached by a
different field — and it was unscanned from the day the field was added (#2094)
until this gate covered it. The report carries `profile_text_fields`, the count
of profile strings actually read; a map that is present but yields zero, or a
PROFILED class whose text the walk never reached, is a FINDING, because a scan
that reads nothing and a subject that is clean look identical from the verdict.

Structural invariants also checked: the DB parses, every entry has ic_class +
non-empty lessons, and lesson_count matches. The OPTIONAL `related[]` cross-link
field (sibling ic_class names sharing a core craft — the lightweight concept
graph) must, when present, be a list of strings that each name an EXISTING
ic_class, with no self-reference and no duplicates (a dangling link would point
the author at knowledge that isn't there).

Run CLEAN on the shipped DB before merge (exit 0). chip-AGNOSTIC.
