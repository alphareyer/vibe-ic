"""tap_row_coverage_check — does every active cell have a well tie in ITS OWN
WELL ISLAND within the distance the PDK's DRC deck requires? Judged on the
TOOL's DEF.

WHY THIS PROGRAM EXISTS (review70 step 15, harvest item 2; T96)
===============================================================
Step 15 on the chip path is LibreLane `OpenROAD.TapEndcapInsertion`: OpenROAD
`tapcell -distance FP_TAPCELL_DIST`, with the distance from the PDK's LibreLane
config. The direct deck kept two things of its own around the same command, the
#684 post-placement tap prune and the post-route well-tie coverage repair, and
review70 dropped both from the tool path (they cost correctness twice: DF.13/14
60 violations from the prune, 5 KLayout / 15 Magic markers from the repair on
spm final14). What it kept is the LESSON they were built on, as a gate:

  * The number is the FOUNDRY's. The deck states it (gf180mcu `comp.rb`:
    `# Rule DF.13_MV: Max distance of Nwell tap ... is 15um.`), per voltage
    class; a flow knob is only a request. The caller resolves it through the
    runner's one reader (`deck_tap_max_distance_um`) and passes it with its
    source.
  * Coverage counts inside one WELL ISLAND. DF.13 grows the tap inside
    n-well: two abutted rows that share their power edge share one n-well,
    while the neighbour across the ground edge is a separate island (MEASURED
    by the direct flow: `wire70` sat 7.84 um from a tie one row below, across
    that edge, and violated). The substrate taps (DF.14) pair the other way.

  MEASURED on the spm LibreLane chain (0.3.79, FP_TAPCELL_DIST 20, gf180mcuD):
  OpenROAD's two-phase checkerboard lays ties 39.2 um apart in a row and
  19.6 um apart in each n-well island; the KLayout sign-off deck (df_13_mv,
  df_14_mv at 15 um) reads 0. A same-ROW ruler read 181 of 413 active cells
  uncovered on that layout, the island ruler 0 -- the same-row reading was a
  false alarm; the island is the deck's own geometry. The row-start endcap
  ties the well too (its supply pin draws the well in its LEF): without it,
  3 cells read uncovered at 16.8 um.

THE RULE
========
Over the DEF's own ROWS and placed COMPONENTS, with master geometry and pin
use from the LEFs the step read:

  * A TIE is a placed instance of the declared tap master, or of the endcap
    master when its own LEF shows its supply pin drawing the well.
  * A row's n-well edge is the edge its POWER rail sits on (from the tap
    master's LEF); a flipped row (FS, S) turns it over. Rows sharing an n-well
    edge form one n-well island; rows sharing a ground edge, one substrate
    island.
  * An ANCHOR is a placed CORE instance, not a tie, with at least one
    non-supply pin whose DIRECTION is INPUT, OUTPUT or INOUT -- the functional
    selector the direct repair used, so no PDK cell is named here.
  * `--scope cells`: every point of every anchor's extent must be within the
    deck distance of a tie in its n-well island AND of one in its substrate
    island (TAP_ROW_COVERAGE_GAP). The worst point of an extent is one of its
    ends or a midpoint between consecutive ties inside it, so those are the
    points measured (exactly; no sampling grid).
  * `--scope lattice`: the tool's lattice itself, on a DEF with nothing placed
    (TapEndcapInsertion's output): every point of every row span, the same way
    (TAP_LATTICE_GAP). This is the pre-placement check the review asked for,
    as a measurement of what the tool built rather than a formula over its
    knob.

Exit codes: 0 PASS, 1 FAIL, 2 NOT_MEASURED (unreadable input, no row, the tap
master absent from every LEF, a placed row master of unknown geometry, or --
`cells` -- no anchor at all: a floorplan with nothing placed proves nothing).
