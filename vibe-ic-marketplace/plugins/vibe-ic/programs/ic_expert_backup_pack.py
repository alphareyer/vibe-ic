r"""ic_expert_backup_pack.py — assemble the IC-Expert-Agent AI-backup context pack.

GENERAL CORE (benchmark-AGNOSTIC). When a deterministic track cannot author a
body (the common case — a non-standard design), the plugin's answer is NOT a
generic LLM: it is to let the AI act AS the **IC Expert Agent**, USING the two
expert assets the agent owns —

  * expert-SKILLS — the ACTIVE `### Skill:` sections distilled in
    `agents/ic-expert-agent.md` (rendered to `lessons.md` by
    `_lesson_digest.render_lesson_digest`);
  * expert-DB   — the design-class craft in `agents/ic_expert_db/ic_expert_db.json`,
    retrieved for THIS prompt by `ic_expert_db_query.query` and rendered to
    `ic_expert_db.md` by `_lesson_digest.render_ic_expert_db_digest`.

A MEASURED A/B lesson (see `_lesson_digest.render_lesson_digest` note: folding the
DB into the one skills digest LOWERED single-shot recovery 38→31; the two as
INDEPENDENT authors reached 51) makes this a **DUAL-TRACK** hand-off, not one
blob:

  * Track 1 — general-blind author: prompt + interface contract + `lessons.md`.
  * Track 2 — DB-informed author:  prompt + interface contract + `ic_expert_db.md`.
  * Converge — a comparator diffs the two bodies; disagreement is root-caused and
    reconciled (the program-first + AI-backup dual-track convergence doctrine).

This module does the DETERMINISTIC assembly (retrieve + render + write the
contract + emit the hand-off descriptor). The actual LLM authoring is performed
by invoking the `vibe-ic:ic-expert-agent` subagent on the emitted pack — the
hand-off JSON names exactly that invocation, so an orchestrator (a benchmark
driver, `phase1-orchestrate`, or a human) runs it identically. Reads ONLY the
supplied prompt + interface — never any oracle/harness.

CLASS-FIRST ASSEMBLY, AND A PACK THAT REFUSES TO CLAIM IT IS ASSEMBLED (#2094).
A pack assembled for a design whose REGISTERED `ic_class` the expert DB PROFILES
is `ic_class`-driven end to end:

  * its `db_classes` come from the profile — the class SELECTS, the phrase only
    RANKS within the selection (`ic_expert_db_query.query(..., ic_class=...)`);
  * its `interface_contract` is the profile's `integration_contract` — the field
    set this class's generated integration/constraints layers must carry;
  * its `target_module` is recovered from the design INPUT when the caller has
    none to give;
  * and if, after all that, it still carries no target module and no contract,
    it is stamped `assembly_status: NOT_ASSEMBLED` and says why.

That last point is the actual defect this closes. MEASURED on a crypto
accelerator: the pack carried `target_module: null`, `interface_contract: null`,
`expert_skills: []` and five db_classes none of which was crypto — and it was
handed on as a pack, so a 46-expectation review was recorded as having had an
expert pack in hand when the pack contained nothing about the design's class. A
null pack that READS AS ASSEMBLED is worse than no pack: it launders an empty
context into a credited one. So the status is computed and stated.

An `ic_class` the DB does not profile (including the classifier's terminal
CATCH-ALL, whose registry entry says in its own words that designs landing there
"are UNCLASSIFIED, not classified") is left exactly as before: no confinement,
no contract substitution, no refusal, and a byte-identical descriptor. Refusing
a pack for a class nobody has profiled would score the classifier's uncertainty
as the design's deficiency. Profiling the remaining registered classes moves
every design's pack at once and belongs in its own change, on its own corpus
sweep — the gap is DECLARED in the DB, class by class, not left implicit.
