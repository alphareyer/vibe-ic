"""_path_layout.py — single source of truth for the project directory tree.

Phase-redesign branch — three Phase buckets defined by deliverable,
not by skill (see docs/architecture/RFC_v2.0_PHASE_REDESIGN.md):

  Phase 1 — structured spec (L1-L23 JSON) ← unified entry for both docs and dialogue
  Phase 2 — verified RTL + gate-level netlist + FPGA SOF
  Phase 3 — sign-off + tapeout + manufacturing (absorbs analog A5-A9, M1-M4, mfg)

# The Step-16 clock plan (`cts_dir()/clock_plan.json`) is built by

# `clock_plan_check`. They used to answer "which files is this plan derived
# from?" DIFFERENTLY — the producer swept `project.rglob("*.sdc")`, the checker
# swept a fixed directory list — so the checker could call stale a plan the
# producer had just written from a file the checker never looked at. The two
# helpers below are that one definition, and both sides call them.
#
# The SET is deliberately identical to the producer's historical `rglob` sweep
# (every `*.sdc` under the project); only the ORDER is canonicalised, so
# adopting it moves no clock into or out of any plan. `clock_plan_check`'s
# SEPARATE dropped-clock view (`_find_sdc_files`, a curated directory list) is
# a different question — "which constraints must the plan account for" — and is
# deliberately left alone: over the tracked corpus the two views disagree on
# the file set for 9 of the 26 SDC-bearing roots and on the harvested
# create_clock names for 4, and the extra files the wide sweep reaches are
# backup/held trees (`phase2/.phase2_held/...`) and un-expanded Tcl (a

#: WHERE A REPORT USED TO BE WRITTEN, by filename. READ SIDE ONLY. R-0915-160.
#:
#: `report_path` above is the ONE answer to "where does this report go", and that is
#: deliberately not negotiable: a producer and its readers disagreeing about a path is the
#: defect R-0915-151 closed, and a reader that enumerates locations for the CURRENT run goes
#: stale the next time a producer moves.
#:
#: Reading a project that ALREADY EXISTS is a different question. `phase1_one_shot_runner`
#: wrote `reports/phase1_one_shot.json` until R-0915-151 moved it onto the router, and every
#: project produced before that still has its pass-1 record there. A reader that cannot see
#: it reports the pass as missing -- measured: `run_second_pass_only` read only the routed
#: path, so on such a project pass 1 was NOT carried forward, the second pass published a
#: record saying so, and the front door halted at phase 1 on a project that had in fact run.
#: `vibe_ic_entry_guard` already tolerated both spellings and called this one "legacy"; this
#: is that tolerance with ONE definition instead of four.
#: MAPS ONE NAME TO EVERY OLDER LOCATION A READER USED TO ACCEPT, in order of preference.
#:
#: It is a TUPLE per name because `analog_one_shot.json` needs two: the router categorises it
#: `phase3`, and `run_status` accepted it at `reports/orchestrator/` and at `reports/` -- neither
#: of which is where the router points.
#:
#: MEASURED, and this table is the shape of a regression I caused. `run_status` had the
#: routed-and-flat pair hand-written three times, for ALL SIX of its phase reports. I replaced
#: those loops with a single call to the resolver below while this table knew ONE name, so five
#: tolerances vanished silently: `test_issue590_auto_picks_the_furthest_phase` stages every report
#: at the flat `reports/<name>.json` and `run_status` answered "UNKNOWN -- no final verdict, no
#: recorded PID and no log or artifact of any kind under this project". Replacing N candidates
#: with a resolver means the resolver must know all N.

#
# WHERE THIS CAME FROM, AND WHY IT MOVED. The question was first asked, and

# phase report that exists is not this run's account of itself unless this run
# wrote it, and a stale record must never authorise a demotion. That reader
# resolves a phase REPORT NAME through the router, so the predicate lived
# behind that resolution and nothing else could ask it.
#
# A SECOND READER NOW NEEDS THE SAME QUESTION ABOUT AN ARBITRARY PATH. A run
# that declares a window (`--entry-step` / `--exit-step`) deliberately does NOT
# refresh the whole-flow documents — `reports/final_summary.md`,
# `reports/audit/phase23_completion_audit.json` — so a reader of that tree must
# be able to tell "this run wrote it" from "this run left the previous run's
# copy in place". That is the same question, and answering it a second time in
# a second place is how two staleness rules come to disagree about one file.
# So the predicate lives here, the phase-report reader delegates to it, and
# `FRESHNESS_TOLERANCE_S` has one value.

# The per-STEP output view: `<project>/steps/<phase>/<stage>/<id>_<slug>/`.
#
# WHY THIS HELPER EXISTS. `step_output_collector.materialize` was called from
# exactly ONE place — `vibe_ic_one_shot_runner`'s finalize — so a run driven
# straight at phase2 / phase3 / analog (how most cells are actually driven)
# ended with NO steps tree at all, and its absence was indistinguishable from
# a run that had nothing to show. MEASURED: a top-runner ibex backend run has
# `steps/` with 63 step folders; `AI_IC_design/4th_benchmark/sha256_rerun_e2e`,
# a phase-driven run with a full phase1/phase2/phase3 tree, has none.
#
# BEST-EFFORT, IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. Building the VIEW must never fail a run and
# must never HANG one — hence the subprocess + timeout, the same idiom
# `emit_final_summary` uses, and a blanket except around the whole body. But
# the failure must not be SILENT either: a run that produced artefacts and no
# steps tree used to look exactly like a run whose orchestrator never had the
# feature. So EVERY call writes `reports/audit/steps_view.json` recording what
# happened and why. That is the surfacing decision, and the reasoning is:
#   * raising  — kills a run over bookkeeping. Forbidden.
#   * a gate   — the view is derived, not evidence; failing a run because a
#                convenience view could not be built is the same crime.
#   * a WARN   — scrolls past, survives in no artefact, cannot be queried.
#   * a RECORD — durable, attributable, costs one small file, and INVERTS the
#                default: "no steps tree" is now a written statement with a
#                reason and a runner name instead of an unexplained absence.
# The stderr WARN is kept as well, for the human watching the run.
#
# The record is VERIFIED, NOT REPORTED. After the collector exits 0 this helper
# stats `steps/index.json` itself and counts the folders; a collector that
# claims success and leaves no tree is recorded as a failure. `nested_folders`
# counts entries whose `folder` has the owner-specified two separators
# (phase/stage/step), so a regression back to a flat `steps/<id>_<slug>/` is
# visible in the record rather than having to be re-derived from the tree.

    file-existence inference. That is how a step whose runner returned FAIL --
