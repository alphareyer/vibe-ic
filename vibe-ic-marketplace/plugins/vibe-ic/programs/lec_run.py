"""lec_run.py — Step 13 LEC PRODUCER (RTL ≡ synthesized gate netlist).

The flow's step-13 gate `lec_equivalence_check.py` VALIDATES
`reports/lec.json`, but nothing ever PRODUCED that artefact — step 13 was
an orphan. This program is the missing executor: it runs a REAL Yosys
equivalence check in the vibeic-eda container and writes a TRUTHFUL
`reports/lec.json` + `reports/lec.rpt`.

It is a PRODUCER, not the judge. It exits 0 whenever it successfully wrote
a truthful report — even when the design turned out non-equivalent, or when
the SAT engine was model-limited on custom-PDK primitives. The downstream
gate `lec_equivalence_check.py` is what decides PASS/FAIL. It exits 1 only
when Yosys / Docker could not run at all (so the runner can fall back to a
disclosed-skip).

The Yosys recipe is PORTED from the mature `yosys_equiv` LVS mode in
`mcp-eda/src/index.js` (equiv_make → equiv_simple → equiv_induct -seq
4/16/64 → equiv_status), including its ANTI-FABRICATION honesty: when
equiv_induct's SAT engine aborts on Liberty cells it cannot model (e.g.
`sky130_fd_sc_hd__lpflow_isobufsrc_1`), we surface a STRUCTURED
`sat_model_unsupported_cells[]` + `verdict:"SKIPPED-CONDITION"` +
`verdict_explanation` — never a fake pass, never the ambiguous `-1`
sentinel. Two recipe adaptations proven necessary against real Vibe-IC
synth netlists (Yosys 0.66, sky130A):
  * `read_verilog -icells` — synth netlists here escape internal gate
    types as user identifiers (`\\$_NOT_`); -icells re-binds them to the
    internal primitives so `hierarchy -check` does not error. Harmless for
    Liberty-mapped netlists (their cells are not `$`-prefixed).
  * `flatten` on both designs — the RTL gold carries sub-module hierarchy
    (e.g. chip_top -> spm); without flatten equiv_make sees an unmodelable
    hierarchical instance and aborts on it. equiv is a comparison of two
    flat cones, so flattening both is sound.

CLI contract (the runner calls this exactly):
    python3 lec_run.py <project_dir> \\
        --gold-rtl-dir phase2/stage1/rtl \\
        --gate-netlist phase2/stage2/synth/netlist.v \\
        --top <top_module> \\
        [--container vibeic-eda] \\
        [--liberty <abs .lib path inside container>] \\
        [--json reports/lec.json]
    main(argv=None) -> int   0 = report produced (PASS or honest SKIP)
                             1 = could not run the tool at all (real error)

Chip-AGNOSTIC — no design-specific assumptions; pure Yosys driving + text
parsing. The only cell names referenced are the PDK's own documented cells.

# PROOF CHECKPOINTS — resume a killed leg instead of re-proving from zero.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS TO REMOVE (measured, 8HD-9, 2026-09-06). yosys marks a
# `$equiv` key-point PROVEN by REWIRING that cell's \B input to the same signal
# as \A. That is ORDINARY RTLIL — no side table, no in-memory-only state — so
# `write_rtlil` / `read_rtlil` ROUND-TRIPS the proven set across a fresh
# process: on a 33-point miter a resumed leg's `equiv_induct` reports
# "Found 1 unproven $equiv cells" where the same pass from zero reports 33, and
# the same holds between induction depths (`-seq 4` -> `-seq 16`).
#
# The engine could therefore always resume. THIS PROGRAM NEVER ASKED IT TO: the
# emitted recipe contained no `write_rtlil` and no `read_rtlil` anywhere, and
# the PASS cache accepts only a COMPLETED proof. So every killed or stalled leg
# re-proved the same points from nothing — measured on sha256, whose two killed
# legs re-proved the same 1060 points twice for 14,390 s of CPU.
#
# WHAT IS AND IS NOT RESUMABLE. yosys writes nothing WHILE a pass runs, so the
# granularity is a whole rung: completed rungs are free on a restart, the rung
# that was in flight is not. That is a limit of the engine, not of this code,
# and it is why the ladder is checkpointed rung by rung rather than by time.
#
# A CHECKPOINT IS NOT A PASS. It carries no verdict, it never seeds or
# satisfies the PASS cache (`pass_cache_eligible` is untouched), and a resumed
# run reaches its verdict the only way any run does — by parsing the fresh
# yosys log its own `equiv_status` produced.

    that reads as measured and is not the quantity it names — and #2194's whole
    acceptance is "the ladder's peak is the MAX of its rungs", which cannot be
    read off an instrument that can miss a rung's maximum entirely. The same
    poll also reports NOTHING for a rung shorter than its interval, which is why
    c071f6253 could only record `legs 2-4 NOT_MEASURED — each ran in under 1 s`
    and had to land `Refs #2194` rather than close it.

    Yosys states the figure itself, in the evidence every run already keeps, and
    nothing read it. `MB` here is `ru_maxrss / 1024` on Linux, so KiB is the
    figure times 1024 — CROSS-CHECKED against the supervisor on the single-
    process arm of the same design, where the poll did catch the maximum:
    211.43 MB -> 216504 KiB against the supervisor's 222940 KiB for the whole

    `proved`, `unproven`, `points` and `equiv_status` appear nowhere in the

    WHY THIS EXISTS -- MEASURED 2026-08-27, on unpatched main 40d0e14c08.
    A `popcount8` gold was synthesised, ONE gate in the netlist was mutated
    (`$_NAND_` -> `$_NOR_`), and `lec_run.py` reported that genuinely
    non-equivalent pair as **INCONCLUSIVE**, not FAIL. The mechanism:

      * the design is purely combinational, so `equiv_simple` correctly left
        the 4 differing output bits unproven;
      * the script then ran `equiv_induct -seq 4/16/64` anyway. On a miter with
        NO state there is nothing to induct over, so every rung necessarily
        printed `Proved 0 previously unproven $equiv cells.`;
      * `induction_did_not_converge` reads exactly that phrase as "a flat
        induction wall", and the classifier re-classes a flat wall from
        NOT_EQUIVALENT to INCONCLUSIVE.

    That re-class is right for a DEEP SEQUENTIAL design, where `-seq 64` really
    can run out of depth. On a stateless design it is unconditional: EVERY real
    combinational mismatch produces that phrase, so the discriminator says "not
    a mismatch" about every mismatch it is shown. A checker that cannot say
    FAIL is not a checker.

    THE OBSERVABLE, not a name guess: this reads the cell histogram YOSYS
    ITSELF printed for the miter module (`stat` after `equiv_make`), and
    returns True only when the histogram was found, counted at least one cell,
    and EVERY type in it is in yosys's own combinational vocabulary. A PDK
    Liberty cell, a `$mem`, a `$_DFF_*`, or any type this list does not know

# real yosys prints "Verilog-2005 frontend: /tmp/frontend/rtl/m.v" — so a bare
# \bfrontend\b also fires on a PATH containing that word. Misfires in the
# DANGEROUS direction: a design-BUILDING pass wrongly counted as a read pass
# empties the non-frontend list and buys the LENIENT verdict (INCONCLUSIVE).
#
# ROUND 2 (their sharpened threat model): requiring `frontend` to be followed by
# `:` / `.` / end was still forgeable, because those separators occur INSIDE
# arguments too — "SOMEPASS pass (reading /work/frontend.)" and
# "… (reading /work/frontend: x)" both satisfied it. Their sharper framing is the
# right one and generalises past LVS: THE DESIGN AND THE ENVIRONMENT NAME THEIR

# paths / net names / cell names is a token those inputs can FORGE. (In netgen's
# case a SystemVerilog escaped identifier legally contains SPACES, so a net can
# spell a verdict phrase exactly.)
#

# <defunct> at the deadline, reports/lec_equiv.ys was rewritten with
# `read_slang` 20s later, and a fresh yosys pid B started on it. NOTHING was
# written to reports/lec.json or reports/lec.rpt at the deadline - not a FAIL,

    """Decide whether to re-read the GOLD with `read_slang`. Returns (retry, why).

    THE RULE (general, design-driven): retry whenever the built-in gold read
    produced NO equivalence miter at all — i.e. `parse_error`, meaning yosys
    printed no proven/unproven/total counts and no SAT-model abort, so ZERO
    points were compared. A zero-miter run carries no equivalence evidence in
    either direction, and `read_slang` is the most capable SV-2017 frontend
    available (the same one `synth` falls back to), so it has not yet been given
    a chance to decide the question.

    WHY NOT the old rule: the retry used to fire only when the yosys log matched
    `_FRONTEND_PARSE_ABORT_RE` — a hard-coded allow-list of error PHRASINGS.
    Any zero-miter abort worded differently silently skipped the capable
    frontend and fell through to a FALSE FAIL (this is exactly how ibex's
    "Parameter ... with non-constant value" elaboration abort was missed until
    the phrase was hand-added). Keying on the OBSERVABLE (no miter was built)
    instead of on the tool's wording removes the whole class of misses.

    §4.05 NO-LEAK — widening the TRIGGER cannot widen what PASSES:
      * `parse_error` is False the moment a miter actually ran, so a genuine
        mismatch (miter ran, points left unproven) can NEVER reach this retry.
      * If slang also builds no miter, `finalize_after_slang_retry` keeps the
        verdict at FAIL — no free non-blocking pass.
      * The VERDICT classification (INCONCLUSIVE vs FAIL) still uses the narrow
        `is_frontend_parse_abort` signature, deliberately NOT widened here: a
        yosys/docker crash with no frontend-abort evidence stays a hard FAIL.
    The `why` string is recorded in reports/lec.json so the fallback and its
    justification are explicit and auditable.

    elaborate the gold, the design is not excused as a built-in-reader tool gap;

    EXCEPTION — the #192 hard-macro staging gap is NOT a gold-frontend failure.
    That INCONCLUSIVE is raised when the GATE side's `hierarchy -check` aborts
    because the netlist instantiates a hard macro whose definition was never
    staged into the miter. The gold RTL elaborated fine; no frontend, however
    capable, can supply a module that is not there, so "slang also failed" is
    not evidence about this design at all. Downgrading it re-introduces exactly
    the harm #192 removed — a comparison that never started, booked as a proven

    "fix the elaboration error", pointing at RTL that is provably fine.

# FUNCTIONAL-MODE (scan-aware) COMPARISON
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# When the gate netlist is a REAL scan-inserted implementation netlist (see
# programs/fault_scan_chain_insert.py), it carries five DFT ports the RTL gold
# does not have — `sin`, `shift`, `test`, `tck` (inputs) and `sout` (output) —
# and its internal wires all carry the prefix `fault chain`'s resynthesis put
# on them.  Two things then break, and BOTH are name/interface problems, not
# equivalence problems:
#
#   1. `equiv_make` HARD-ERRORS on a gate port with no gold counterpart:
#        ERROR: Can't match gate port `test_gate' to a gold port.
#      MEASURED.  So the DFT ports must be REMOVED, not merely constrained;
#      a yosys `connect -set test 1'b0` tie-off leaves them in the port list.
#   2. `equiv_make` matches gold/gate wires BY NAME.  A uniform prefix on one
#      side destroys every internal correspondence and leaves only the output
#      port, which drops the miter from 97 compared points to 1 and sends
#      `equiv_induct` into a non-converging wall.  MEASURED: 63 proven with the
#      prefix mirrored, vs 1 unproven point without.
#
# The fix is a one-level wrapper on EACH side, with the gold wrapper's instance
# name chosen (an escaped identifier containing a dot) so the two `flatten`
# prefixes come out byte-identical:
#
#   gate:  rename <top> <top>__scan
#          module <top>(<rtl ports>)  { <top>__scan \_LECWRAP (…, .sin(1'b0),
#              .shift(1'b0), .test(1'b0), .tck(1'b0), .sout()) }
#   gold:  rename <top> <top>__rtl
#          module <top>(<rtl ports>)  { <top>__rtl \_LECWRAP.<prefix> (…) }
#
# WHAT THIS IS NOT.  It does not compare a different netlist: the file read on
# the gate side is the post-DFT netlist itself, and the wrapper only ties the
# DFT controls to their functional-mode values and drops the scan output.  The
# tie-off VALUES are load-bearing and proven so by controls: tying `test` to 1
# instead of 0 leaves 0 of 63 points proven, tying `shift` to 1 leaves 32
# unproven, and a one-gate `nor2_1`→`nand2_1` corruption of the scan netlist
# leaves 1 unproven.  All three FAIL, so the comparison cannot be vacuous.
#
# EVERY NAME HERE IS KNOWN, NOT SNIFFED.  The four tie-off ports and `sout` are
# `fault chain` OPTION names the scan producer passes; the internal prefix is
# MEASURED from the artefact by `fault_scan_chain_insert.measure_internal_prefix`
# and travels in `reports/phase2/dft/scan_chain.json`.  When the prefix cannot
# be measured the wrapper is still emitted WITHOUT it (the DFT ports still have
# to go) and the compared-point count simply drops — recorded in the report as
# `scan_functional_mode.internal_prefix: null`, never silently.

    so `equiv_simple` cannot structural-match and EVERY point falls to the
    `equiv_induct` SAT engine. The prior recipes handed those points a Liberty
    cell the SAT engine cannot model:
      * `read_liberty -lib <lib>` (the delegated post-layout gate==gate recipe)
        imports the cells as BLACKBOXES with no logic → satgen aborts
        "ERROR: No SAT model available for cell _197__gate (NAND2D1)".
      * `-icells` + flatten aborted `hierarchy` on the Liberty-blackbox flop.
    The fix: on the GATE side read the Liberty WITHOUT `-lib` and with
    `-ignore_miss_func`, which EXPANDS every combinational cell's `function`
    and every `ff`/`latch` group into Yosys internal primitives
    (`NAND2D1` → `$_AND_`+`$_NOT_`; `DFFHQD1` → `$_DFF_P_`), then `flatten`
    inlines them so the netlist is pure `$_`-primitive logic the SAT engine CAN
    model. The GOLD stays RTL (coarse `$`-cells, already satgen-modelable).
    `-ignore_miss_func` degrades HONESTLY: a cell with no `function` (e.g. a
    clock-gating latch `TLATNCAD*`) stays a blackbox, and if the design uses one
    `equiv_induct` still emits "No SAT model …" → SKIPPED-CONDITION, never a
    fake pass.  Measured on a commercial-PDK spm: 65/65 $equiv cells proven, 0 unproven,
    "Equivalence successfully proven!"; a one-gate NAND2D1→NOR2D1 corruption of
    the netlist leaves 2 unproven → the gate FAILs (false-clean-PROOF). The
    induction escalates 4→16→64 frames so a pipelined design proves at the depth
    matching its latency (spm needs frame 2). chip-/PDK-AGNOSTIC.

    `liberty` may be None (a generic `$_`-primitive netlist needs no Liberty; it
    is already satgen-modelable). `blackbox_v` — PDK physical-only cell Verilog
    (fill/tap/decap) read `-lib` so those inert cells become empty blackboxes;
    empty for a pre-PnR synth netlist (those cells are inserted later).

    `gate_is_generic=True` — the gate is a pre-techmap Yosys netlist whose cells
    are escaped internal primitives (`\\$_DFF_P_`, `\\$_NAND_`, …). Read it with
    `read_verilog -icells` and NO Liberty: `-icells` re-binds those escaped names
    to real internal cells so `hierarchy -check` RESOLVES them (a plain
    `read_verilog` treats `\\$_DFF_P_` as an undefined user module and ABORTS
    before `equiv_make` → 0 $equiv points → a false compared_points=0 FAIL). The
    resulting `$_`-primitive gate is already satgen-modelable, so equiv proceeds
    normally. chip/PDK-AGNOSTIC — no Liberty vocabulary is involved.

    #155 — a `memory_map` PASS runs on EACH side after `prep` / `hierarchy`
    (which have already run `proc; memory_collect`, so any memory is a packed
    `$mem`/`$mem_v2` cell) and BEFORE `flatten`, legalizing the memory to
    flops + address-decode gates that equiv_induct's satgen CAN model. Without
    it a memory-bearing gold aborts `equiv_induct` with `No SAT model available
    for cell … ($mem_v2)` → an honest SKIPPED-CONDITION that never actually
    compared the design. This is plain stock-yosys 1042b3f55 (no fork flag, no
    capability probe — the `memory_map` command has shipped for years). ORDER
    IS LOAD-BEARING: it must run PRE-flatten (a `memory_map` placed AFTER
    `flatten`/`splitnets` leaves every $equiv point unproven — verified 0/8 vs
    136/0 in-container), and each side must legalize its own module BEFORE
    `equiv_make` merges them. NO-LEAK: on a design with NO memory `memory_map`
    is a no-op, so a non-memory LEC verdict is byte-unchanged; a memory-bearing
    EQUIVALENT design now PROVES ("Equivalence successfully proven!"), and a
    broken one stays unproven → FAIL (sound negative)."""

    # 19 of 19 extracted FSMs recoded to one-hot; e.g. a 3-bit sparse
    # `...u_prim_alert_sender.state_q` became a 7-bit one-hot register).

    # `splitnets -ports` DEFEATS that guard. Contrary to what its name

    # equiv_make then no longer sees one 3-bit wire against one 7-bit wire; it
    # sees `state_q[0..2]` on each side and matches them POSITIONALLY. Those
    # pairs are not the same signal. Forcing them equal makes the miter's
    # key-point set INCONSISTENT, and `equiv_induct`'s base case — which asks
    # whether ALL unproven key points CAN be simultaneously equal for k
    # consecutive cycles — goes UNSAT and prints `Circuit inherently
    # diverges!`. One poisoned pair aborts the induction for the WHOLE design:

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE ONE PROOF TAIL, SHARED BY EVERY LEC PATH (vibe-ic#2151)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY THIS FUNCTION EXISTS. Until v1.18.98 this plugin ran TWO LEC recipes:
# `build_equiv_script` above (pre-layout, RTL vs synth netlist) and a SECOND,
# INDEPENDENT copy in `lec_post_layout_check.build_yosys_equiv_script`
# (post-layout, reference netlist vs routed netlist). The v1.18.0 LEC-recipe
# fix — `stat` + the SAT-free `equiv_struct` pre-reduction ahead of any SAT
# spend, and the `equiv_simple -short` first rung — landed in THIS file only.
# The post-layout copy kept the pre-v1.18.0 strategy (`equiv_simple` straight
# into `equiv_induct -seq 4/16/64`), so the fix never reached the step that
# proves the ROUTED netlist. MEASURED on the sha256 post-route netlist
# (8HD-8, rbsha2's own run): the post-layout first pass spent 43289.65 s —
# 99% of it in 3x `equiv_induct`, 17.7 GB peak — to arrive at 134 unproven,
# because every structurally-identical cone was handed to the SAT engine
# instead of being collapsed by `equiv_struct` first.
#
# WHAT IT GUARANTEES. One function emits the strategy, so a future rung, a
# future pre-reduction or a future budget marker cannot land on one path and
# miss the other. `test_lec_one_recipe.py` pins that both builders derive
# from this function and that the pre-layout text did not move.
#
# `seq_depths=None` -> the shipped `LEC_LADDER` verbatim (the pre-layout
# caller). An explicit ascending depth list -> the same first rung followed by
# one `equiv_induct` per depth; that is the post-layout caller's
# already-documented `--seq-depths` knob, and with its default (4, 16, 64) the
# emitted text is IDENTICAL to the ladder. Deeper induction is sound (it only
# proves more), so a caller-chosen depth cannot weaken the proof.

    the container cgroup's `oom_kill` counter sampled BEFORE and AFTER, so a
    memory kill can be told apart from the wall-clock backstop that shares its

    ORDINARILY written as RELATIVE paths, and the synthesis that produced the
    gate netlist resolved them because it ran beside the resources the runner
    staged for it. Reading the gold from a DIFFERENT directory makes those same
    relative paths unresolvable, which aborts the gold elaboration and yields a

       NOT_EQUIVALENT — this change is what turns the honest non-result into
       an actual comparison.)

        # 16.3 GB with `oom_kill 0` when it is the only rung in the process. So
        # 48 GiB was never that rung's footprint.
        #
        # WHY A BIGGER CEILING IS NOT THE REPAIR. It buys exactly one more rung
        # and then dies again — a limit moved to fit the job it just failed,
        # the same shape as a 600 s bound on a 983 s gate (#2177). A ladder
        # whose memory grows with the NUMBER OF RUNGS can only be sized for a
        # machine, and then only until the next design.

        # THE REPAIR. Each rung runs in a FRESH process, resuming from the

        # and scales with the design instead of with the host.
        #
