"""analog_resolution_stimulus.py — the A4 corner deck's RESOLUTION stimulus.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS (vibe-ic#2188, MEASURED)
===============================================
`analog_adc_enob_corner_check` grades the one figure of merit a data converter
is defined by — its effective resolution — and it states, per corner and by
name, the two properties a deck must have before that number can exist:

    no_transient_dump: the deck writes no `wrdata` file
    stimulus_not_a_coherent_tone: the deck drives the converter input from a
        DC source, and SNDR is a signal bin against everything else

Measured on the live tip (base ``e2b3c08170b5``) against a real front-door run
of a second-order incremental modulator: nine corners really simulated, every
one of them ``UNMEASURED`` with BOTH reasons, ``blocks_graded 0``. Nothing in
the A-track emitted a deck either property could be read off — not for that
design, and not for any design, because no producer ever wrote a `wrdata` into
a corner deck and no testbench drove a converter input from anything but a DC
level. The consumer was honest and the capability did not exist.

This module is that capability. It is a pure text-in / text-out transform over
ONE corner deck, so it is testable without a simulator, and it is wired into
`analog_real_corner_sweep` at the single point where a corner deck is rendered.

WHAT IT CHANGES IN A DECK, AND ONLY THIS
========================================
For a block whose bound spec declares an ENOB (or SNDR) target:

  1. the DC source on the block's DECLARED signal-input port becomes a SIN
     source CENTRED ON THE SAME DC LEVEL, so every measurement the delivered
     deck already takes over that input keeps its expected value — a bitstream
     density that reads the input's fraction of the reference span reads the
     same fraction, because the mean of a symmetric tone is its offset;
  2. one `wrdata` of the block's own measured output node is added to the
     transient the deck already runs.

It does NOT lengthen the record, move a device, re-time a clock, or add an
analysis. The corner sweep runs exactly the simulations it already ran.

IT REFUSES BY NAME RATHER THAN GUESS
====================================
Every input above is read off the DESIGN — the deck the corner is about to run
and the topology IR that block was emitted from — never off a table here. When
one of them is not there the transform is not applied and the record says which
one, with the arithmetic, so the reader is told what to change:

    signal_input_port_not_declared        the IR names no signal-chain input
    signal_input_source_absent            no top-level DC source drives it
    output_node_not_measured              the deck measures no top-level node
    output_node_ambiguous                 it measures more than one
    sample_clock_not_identifiable         no single top-level pulse source
    no_transient                          the deck runs no `tran`
    record_too_short_for_an_in_band_tone  the arithmetic below does not close

THE ARITHMETIC, AND WHY THE TONE SITS WHERE IT DOES
===================================================
The record holds ``N = tstop * fclk`` converter samples. An oversampled
converter is graded over its SIGNAL BAND, ``fclk / (2 * OSR)``, which is the
first ``N / (2 * OSR)`` bins of the record's spectrum — that is what OSR MEANS,
and a resolution taken over the whole Nyquist span of a 1-bit modulator output
measures its shaped out-of-band noise instead of its resolution.

The tone is placed at an ODD bin at most a THIRD of the way to the band edge.
Odd, so the bins either side of it are not its own leakage. A third, so the
second and third harmonics of the tone land INSIDE the graded band: SNDR is
signal against noise AND DISTORTION, and a tone parked at the band edge pushes
every harmonic out of the band and quietly reports an SNR as if it were an
SNDR. That is the flattering answer, so it is the one this file refuses to
give.

Hence the floor: the band must hold ``3 x _MIN_SIGNAL_CYCLES`` bins, i.e.

    N >= 2 * OSR * HARMONICS_IN_BAND * (the first ODD bin at or above
                                        _MIN_SIGNAL_CYCLES)

with ``_MIN_SIGNAL_CYCLES`` imported from the consumer that will do the fit, so
the producer's floor and the consumer's refusal cannot drift apart. The bin is
rounded UP to odd because an even one is never emitted, and a floor that
ignored that would publish a record length that is still refused when a reader
lengthens the deck to exactly it.

chip-AGNOSTIC. No design, block, PDK, node or vendor literal appears here; the
only constants are the ones named above and the amplitude margin.

# ── the tone an INCREMENTAL converter can actually be graded at ────────────
#
# WHAT WAS WRONG, MEASURED (lane icadc, F167). The rule below the incremental
# branch picks `band_bins // HARMONICS_IN_BAND` — one third of the decoded
# Nyquist, BY CONSTRUCTION. At OSR 256 over a 13824-sample record that is bin
# 9 of 54 conversion windows: exactly ONE TONE CYCLE PER SIX WINDOWS, with
# `gcd(9, 54) = 9`.
#
# An incremental converter's decoded error is DETERMINISTIC and periodic with
# the tone. When the tone's period in conversion windows is a small integer,
# so is the error's, and the error becomes a component AT THE SIGNAL'S OWN
# FREQUENCY — which an SNDR removes as signal. Measured on a pure-arithmetic
# ideal CIFB2, same loop, same graded span of 48 decoded windows, tone bin
# swept: every bin from 2 to 15 reads 10.7 - 11.6 bit and bin 8 (= 48/6, the
# bin the rule picks) reads 13.37. Against the method-free truth — the decoded
# value against the input the loop actually saw, no spectrum anywhere — that
# same placement is the WORST of the set (rms 3.35e-4 where the others are
# 2.7e-4 to 3.0e-4, i.e. 10.54 bit). **The instrument read the worst placement
# as 2.8 bit the best.** That is a false green in a graded metric, and it is
# systematic: one third of a Nyquist is a simple rational of the decoded
# record for every OSR whose band edge is divisible by three.
#
# THE RULE THAT REPLACES IT. The tone is chosen in the DECODED domain, where
# the converter is actually graded: `c` whole cycles across `m` graded
# conversion windows, with
#
#     gcd(c, m) == 1     so the error's period is the WHOLE graded span and
#                        its energy cannot collapse onto the signal bin
#     c odd              (kept from the old rule)
#     c * HARMONICS_IN_BAND <= m / 2    so the harmonics are graded too
#     c >= _MIN_SIGNAL_CYCLES           so the bin is not too coarse to mean
#                                       anything
#
# and the record holds `m + 1` windows, because the gate drops the power-up
# window — the counter's first reset can fall anywhere inside it.
