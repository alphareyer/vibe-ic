"""analog_incremental_decimator.py — R-0915-70: the matched decimator for an
INCREMENTAL converter, DERIVED from the loop's own recurrence.

WHY THIS EXISTS. L5 can declare a converter INCREMENTAL — "resets/accumulates
per conversion window" — and the emitted deck then resets its integrators every
N clocks (measured on this IC: exactly every 256 clocks, lane icadc
2026-09-16). A free-running delta-sigma earns its resolution from noise shaping
accumulated over the WHOLE record, and an FFT of the raw bitstream is the right
instrument for it. An incremental converter throws that accumulation away every
window BY DESIGN and earns its resolution from the MATCHED DECIMATION of each
window. Reading one with the other's instrument UNDER-READS it.

MEASURED, end to end through `analog_adc_enob_corner_check`'s own path, on a
bitstream from a pure-arithmetic ideal CIFB2 with no simulator anywhere
(54 conversion windows of 256 clocks, a coherent tone at bin 9):

    matched decimation (this module)   ENOB 13.366 bit   SNDR 82.226 dB
    the raw bitstream's in-band FFT    ENOB  7.775 bit   SNDR 48.565 dB

**5.6 bits.** That difference is the whole reason this module exists, and it is
a property of the DECODE, not of any circuit: the same bits read two ways.

AND THE WINDOW HAS TO BE ALIGNED TO THE RESET. The same record with every
window boundary moved half a conversion — the identical bits — reads **6.368
bit**, 7.0 bit below the aligned decode. An incremental converter's window is
the unit of its answer, and a boundary put half a window wrong averages two
conversions together. That is why the alignment is derived from the deck's own
clock card rather than assumed at t=0.

THE WEIGHTS ARE DERIVED, NOT TYPED. For a CIFB2 with reset,

    I1[n] = I1[n-1] + a1 * (u[n] - v[n])          I1[0] = 0  (the reset)
    I2[n] = I2[n-1] + a2 * I1[n-1]                I2[0] = 0

so the second integrator's value after N clocks is a DOUBLE sum, and collecting
terms gives

    I2[N] = a1*a2 * sum_{k} (N-1-k) * (u[k] - v[k])

I2[N] is bounded by the loop, so the weighted sums of u and v agree and the
decoded output is the TRIANGULARLY weighted mean of the bitstream. This module
computes those weights by running the recurrence itself
(:func:`matched_weights`) rather than writing `N-1-k` down: a coefficient set or
a cascade depth this file does not anticipate then gets the weights its own
recurrence implies, and a typed closed form would silently be wrong.

THE COEFFICIENT DOES APPEAR, and the earlier version of this paragraph said it
did not. That was true of the INPUT-injected weights, where `a1*a2` is a common
factor of every term and cancels in the normalised mean; it stopped being true
with the DAC-injected correction below, because the bit-to-output response
carries a FLAT `a2` term where the input's carries only `a1*a2`. So the decode
is insensitive to the coefficient only while every stage shares it — which is
what the shipped entries declare, one derivation per cascade — and a cascade
with UNEQUAL coefficients has to extend this rather than pass the first one.
`analog_resolution_stimulus.incremental_decode` refuses such an entry BY NAME
instead of averaging them.

What remains scale-invariant is the BITSTREAM: the same ideal model at a1=a2 of
1.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.0625 produces the identical bits, because a
sign-based quantiser is scale-invariant. Only the decode's normalisation cares.

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT CLAIM. On the pure-arithmetic ideal model the
matched decode reaches 13.366 bit where the standard incremental-2nd-order
result is log2(N(N-1)/2) = 14.994. The 1.6-bit gap that remains is the input
MOVING inside a conversion window — an incremental converter answers about one
window, and a tone is not constant across it — and it is a property of the
architecture at this N and this order, not of the decode. It is recorded here
because it is the honest ceiling this instrument can report, and it is BELOW a
14-bit target: a design graded against one has to change N or the order, and
no decode can be asked to make up the difference.

This module is the right instrument for the class; it is not a claim that any
particular loop meets its target.

    CORRECTED (R-0915-70, second pass), and the correction is worth 7.4 bits.
    The first version injected the impulse at the INPUT and took the triangular
    `N-1-k` response. **The bits do not enter at the input.** In a CIFB the DAC
    feeds EVERY integrator — `a1*d` into the first, `a2*d` into the second — so
    the bit-to-output response carries a FLAT term the input's does not:

        input -> output    a1*a2*(N-1-k)
        bit   -> output  -(a1*a2*(N-1-k) + a2)

    Decoding the bits with the INPUT's weights drops that flat `a2*sum(d)`
    term: a signal-dependent error of order `a2*N`. MEASURED on a
    pure-arithmetic ideal CIFB2 — no simulator — scored by ABSOLUTE error
    against the true input over 512 held levels:

        DAC-injected weights    gain 0.99986   rms error   1.60 LSB   14.315 bit
        input-injected weights  gain 0.96898   rms error 263.53 LSB    6.953 bit

    **7.4 bits, and a 3 % gain error.** The input weights give a SMALL residual
    about their own WRONG line, which is exactly why the mistake survived a
    residual-only check: only comparing against the true input exposes it.

    Still derived, not typed — the response is computed by running the cascade,
    from the right injection point.

    `feedback_delay` — MEASURED, and it is NOT a second 7-bit correction. On a
    bitstream that is already fixed the two weight sets differ only by a
    one-sample shift of the flat DAC term, and that is far below the residual:
    the same two real records read 5.693 / 5.685 bit (an ideal-element SPICE
    harness) and 4.173 / 4.172 bit (a real corner) under delay 0 and delay 1
    weights. What the delay DOES cost is 2.0 bit in the LOOP — an incremental
    converter throws its last decision's feedback away at the reset — and that
    is a topology property, not a decode this function can undo. The parameter
    is here so a loop that declares a delayed DAC is decoded by the recurrence
    it actually realises, not so a number can be improved by choosing it.

    `coeff` is the per-stage coefficient. It cancels in the normalised decode
    only while every stage shares it: the flat term carries `a2` where the
    triangular term carries `a1*a2`, so a cascade with UNEQUAL coefficients
    would need them separately. Every entry this file is reached from declares
    one coefficient per stage from a single derivation, so one value is the
    honest signature; an unequal-coefficient cascade must extend this, not
    pass the first one.
