"""area_budget_basis_gen.py — derive step 0.5ic's `synthesis_area_budget`
answer from the design's own documents and the OWNER-ATTESTED deliverable.

WHY A PRODUCER (R-0929-DELIVERABLE-CONSISTENCY, owner go 2026-09-29)
===================================================================
MEASURED: two designs' `input/step_0_5ic_answers.json` carry the owner-attested
`deliverable = DIE` (R-0915-95, 2026-09-17) beside a `synthesis_area_budget`
rationale written on 2026-09-06, while the deliverable was still an agent's
HARDMACRO, that says "declares deliverable=HARDMACRO". The owner changed the
answer; the text that DEPENDED on it had no producer, so nothing re-derived it
and it went on asserting the route the owner had overruled.

The owner's answer is authoritative and is never rewritten here. The derived
answer is REGENERATED — never hand-edited — from two inputs:

  * the design's documents: where they decline a die size, where they say the
    die area is decided by the run, the std-cell area gate row, and any
    die-area figure (with or without a comparator);
  * the owner-attested deliverable, read through
    `_tapeout_declaration.answer`, so an unattested value is NOT_DETERMINED and
    this program refuses instead of writing a premise nobody declared.

THE PREMISE IS READ, NEVER TYPED
================================
The deliverable sentence is rendered from the attested value and from the
input's die disposition. For a DIE whose input DECLINES a die size it states
the ruling's basis: the die area is an OUTCOME of the run (a pad-limited die:
die = core + pad ring + power ring, sized by the pad-ring perimeter when the
pad count dominates), and the input's std-cell area gate still applies. For an
input that FIXES the die the status is LIMIT with that rectangle, and nothing
about the die is called an outcome (R-0929-DELIVERABLE-CONSISTENCY-2). For a HARDMACRO it keeps the earlier meaning
(a macro takes no operator slot whose geometry could supply a ceiling).
`NOT_APPLICABLE` disposes of the die LIMIT only; the std-cell gate is carried
in `stdcell_area_gate`, with its file, line and row.

                                       STRUCTURE the step-0.5ic gate compares
                                       with the owner's current answer
                                       (R-0929-DELIVERABLE-CONSISTENCY-2)
  answer_revisions[]                   one record per change: reason, the
                                       rulings followed (this ruling and the
                                       one cited by the owner's attestation),
                                       the previous text's sha256 and the
                                       previous provenance record

Nothing else in the file changes, except one line appended to a `_comment`
that says nothing in the file is derived by a program. A second run with the
same inputs writes nothing.

REFUSALS (nothing is written)
=============================
  rc 1  the deliverable is not owner-attested; the input both fixes and
        declines a die; the input gates a die AREA with no dimensions (a LIMIT
        carries two, and none is invented); the answers file is unreadable.
  rc 2  the input neither fixes nor declines a die size: the answer stays
        unanswered, never a default. Also a usage error.

chip-AGNOSTIC: no design, process, library or vendor name. Every value comes
from the design's input at run time.
