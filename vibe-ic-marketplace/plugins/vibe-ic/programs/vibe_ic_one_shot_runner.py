"""vibe_ic_one_shot_runner.py — full Vibe-IC flow orchestrator.

Top-level chain that runs the entire spec → silicon pipeline:

    Phase 1 (optional)  → input/phase1_* → generated_docs/L*.json

    Phase 2 (= 2a + 2b) → input/docs → 13 L docs → RTL → SOF → <half-duplex-tester>

    Phase 3              → synth → PnR → GDS → DRC → LVS

chip-AGNOSTIC. Auto-detects entry point:
  - Path A (NL prompt):  <project>/input/phase1_structured.yaml present
  - Path B (vendor docs): <project>/input/docs/ already populated;
                          phase1 SKIPped automatically.

Halt rules:
  - Phase 1 FAIL → halt before Phase 2
  - Phase 2 FAIL → halt before Phase 3 (and analog skipped if not run yet)
  - Analog WAIVED is non-blocking
  - Phase 3 FAIL → final verdict FAIL but report still emitted

    A REFERENCE, NEVER AN Id (#2085). This used to be

    the id was right about IDENTITY and wrong about SHAPE: `.Image` is a bare
    `sha256:<64 hex>`, which `docker run` accepts and which is not a reference.
    The far end -- `_eda_image.judged_image()` -- reads this variable as one,
    split it into repository `sha256` + tag, re-attached the pinned digest, and
    handed `docker run` the string ``sha256@sha256:8c5694…``: rc=125, the
    gf180mcuD tech LEF unread, and `database_unit_um` published as
    NOT_DETERMINED with nothing saying the reference had been malformed.

    The preference that keeps BOTH properties -- immutable, and resolvable --
    is the registry-portable digest reference:

      1. `.Config.Image` when the container was already started from
         `<repo>@sha256:<digest>`, verbatim: same repository the operator named;
      2. otherwise that same identity recovered from the image's own
         RepoDigests (`_eda_pin.container_image_reference`);
      3. otherwise the recorded `image_ref` IF it is a reference at all -- a tag
         is mutable, which is the weakness this whole capture exists to correct,
         but a tag resolves and an Id does not name a place at all;
      4. otherwise NOTHING, with the reason recorded. Exporting an Id "because

    Three independent holes produced that one line, and each is closed here:

    1. NOT_MEASURED had no branch. The old body tested FAIL, then the
       waiver-ish tier, then `return "PASS"` -- so any token outside those two
       sets rolled up to PASS by falling off the end. Closed by inverting the
       polarity: a verdict is a pass only if it is IN `_PHASE_PASS` /
       `_PHASE_PASS_WITH_NOTE`, so an unknown token is not-measured, never a pass.

    2. `rc` was recorded in the plan and in the report and consulted by nothing.
       A phase that reports PASS while exiting non-zero is a REPORT DISAGREEING
       WITH A PROCESS, which is not a pass either; it fails, and the disclosure
       names both halves.

    3. The completion audit was not in the conjunction. run22's
       reports/audit/phase23_completion_audit.json says `verdict: FAIL` and
       phase3's own orchestrator report carries `completion_audit_verdict: FAIL`
       -- and the front door read neither. A completion audit that FAILS is a
       FAIL here; an ABSENT one is disclosed but not gating, because a
       phase1-only or phase2-only run legitimately has none.

    Returns `(verdict, disclosures)`. A roll-up that moves a verdict without
    saying which phase moved it is the same silence in a different place, so the

    THE CANONICAL DOCUMENT, AND NOTHING THAT CARRIES ITS VERDICT. R-0915-151.
    My round-2 version checked freshness on the CARRIER instead of the carried
    verdict, which a review caught: `phase3_one_shot_runner`'s finalize refresh
    swallows a TimeoutExpired (or any exception), and `_derive_headline_verdict`
    then reads `reports/audit/phase23_completion_audit.json` with NO date check and
    copies its verdict into a FRESH `phase3_one_shot.json` as
    `completion_audit_verdict`. So on a re-run whose refresh failed, the OLD run's
    audit PASS arrived at the front door dated today: my reader put the audit FILE in
    `ignored` and then accepted the SAME verdict from the carrier, axis PASS, exit 0
    -- precisely the swallowed-refresh case the rework claimed to close. The mirror
    is worse: a stale FAIL gating a good run.

    So a carrier is a POINTER, never a source. The axis reads the canonical audit
    document itself, and accepts it only when:

      * phase3 ran in THIS invocation (otherwise there is no axis at all), AND
      * the document was written at or after PHASE 3's START in this invocation --
        not merely after the run started, because the audit is phase3's to refresh,
        AND
      * the document says it judged the WHOLE FLOW.

    THAT LAST CHECK IS WHAT 77 MADE POSSIBLE. `flow_compliance_check` stamped every
    receipt `phase: "all"` regardless of `--stage`, so "who wrote this audit, over
    what population" was unanswerable; a phase-2-scoped audit, or
    `emit_final_summary`'s pre-Step-29 snapshot, was accepted as the phase2/3 axis.
    With R-0915-147 the audit carries `scope.whole_flow`, and a scoped pass no longer
    writes this path at all (R-0915-150). An audit with NO scope block predates that
    work, so its population cannot be established from the document: it is accepted
    only on the weaker `phase == "all"` signal, and WHICH signal was used is
    disclosed, because a weak signal read silently is the same mistake again.

    4 KB buffer until exit while its children — which inherit the same fd and

    ALL child output first and ALL banners last.

    loop — at lines 109-131, ABOVE its own banner. Reproduced from first
    principles with a 6-line parent/child script: banners emerge in order with
    line buffering on and after everything with it off.

    uses to attribute a failure to a phase. Set once here rather than as

    # uses, and the one benchmark_dispatch drives -- went on running its own tail
    # unconditionally. So the leak survived at the front door, and worse, the
    # phase-2 report's `not_refreshed_here` was contradicted on disk moments
    # later by this function rewriting the very file it named.
    #
    # Decided from the signals THIS function already has, the same way
    # `design_one_shot_runner.run_is_bounded` is: an entry owned by phase 2
    # means Phase 1 does not run here at all (the line above), and
    # `window_is_effective` answers whether the exit prunes any site ANYWHERE in
    # the flow -- an exit inside phase 2 prunes every phase-3 site. A flag that
