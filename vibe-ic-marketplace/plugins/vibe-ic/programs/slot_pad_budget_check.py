"""slot_pad_budget_check — does this design's interface FIT the purchased slot?

ENFORCEMENT: blocking
=====================
A DOES_NOT_FIT verdict (rc 1) FAILs the step that guards it. The declaration
opens this line deliberately: `flow_gate_enforcement_audit` reads it anchored,
and a mention inside a sentence is not a declaration (#886).

Blocking is only true because `design_one_shot_runner.step_slot_pad_budget`
SPAWNS this program and maps its exit status to the step verdict. The
`program_exit_zero` clause in the flow definition is not, by itself, enough:
those clauses are evaluated by `flow_compliance_check`, which the runner
invokes as `final_audit` -- the LAST step, after every artefact is written.
That is the measured #306 defect, and a gate wired only in the YAML can
describe a run that already happened but cannot refuse one.

WHAT BLOCKING DOES NOT YET MEAN. The FAIL reddens the step and the run's
aggregate verdict; it does not itself skip Phase 3. Making a pad-budget
refusal cascade into "do not place and route this" is a policy change to the
runner's step plan and is left to the maintainer, named here rather than
implied.

WHY THIS EXISTS
===============
MEASURED (gf180mcuD chip-path campaign, 2026-08-20). Nine benchmark ICs were
taken down the chip path. Five of them cannot be bonded out on ANY purchasable
slot, and every one of those five was discovered by running a build until it hit
a wall — hours of synthesis, placement and routing to learn an arithmetic fact
that was decidable in two seconds from files the flow had ALREADY ingested at
step 0.5ic.

    IC                       declared signal bits    largest slot     ratio
    caravel_user_project     637                     52               12.2x
    opentitan_aes            515                     52                9.9x
    ibex                     262                     52                5.0x
    edge_llm_accel           120                     52                2.3x
    edge_llm_matmul_accel    109                     52                2.1x

THE LAST ROW READ 107 UNTIL IT WAS RE-MEASURED. It is 109, and the two bits are
worth the paragraph because they are a rule, not a typo. That design declares
TWO clocks and TWO resets -- its own `clk`/`rst_n` and a bus-side pair. A slot
publishes ONE dedicated clock pad and ONE dedicated reset pad, so exactly one of
each rides for free and the SECOND pair must consume signal budget like any
other port. Counting them is what makes 109.

Do not "fix" the clk/rst recogniser to match the bus-side spellings. Excluding a
port declares that a dedicated pad exists for it, which SHRINKS the budget, and
a smaller interface is how a design that cannot be bonded out reads as FITS.
Over-counting a clock can only refuse a design that would have fitted; the
inverse silently ships one that cannot be bonded. There is a test pinning the
second pair as counted.

THOSE ARE ELABORATED COUNTS, and saying so costs one line and saves a reader an
hour. Every figure above assumes the design's width parameters were SUPPLIED.
Run the same design without them and this program does not return a smaller
number -- it returns UNDECIDED, because a width nobody supplied is not a pad
count it may invent. Re-measured on the published corpus: the first row sums to
502 of its elaborated total with four widths unresolved, and the verdict is
UNDECIDED, not a 502-bit refusal. A reader who compares an unelaborated run
against this table and finds it short has found that rule, not a defect.

The pad inventory is not a guess and not a constant written into this file: step
0.5ic ingests the shuttle operator's own slot files, and each one LISTS ITS PADS
BY INSTANCE, per die side. This gate counts them.

THE OTHER HALF — A FIT THAT NEEDS A BOND-OUT DECISION, NAMED NOT TAKEN
=======================================================================
`sha256` declares 75 signal bits against 52 pads and LOOKS unbuildable by the
arithmetic above. It fits, and it now has silicon-shaped evidence that it fits,
because `write_data[31:0]` and `read_data[31:0]` are never live in the same
transaction and bond onto ONE 32-bit bidirectional bus turned around by the
design's own `cs & ~we`:

    75 declared  ->  32 (shared bus) + cs + we + address[7:0] + error  =  43   <= 52

So the arithmetic alone would have REFUSED a design that a competent bond-out
fits. This gate therefore reports FOLD CANDIDATES — a same-width input bus and
output bus that could share one bidirectional group — and it does NOT apply
them and does NOT assert that any particular pair is safe to fold. Whether two
buses are ever simultaneously active is a PROTOCOL fact about the design; the
candidate list is decidable, the safety is not, and this program does not
pretend otherwise. A candidate is an invitation to a human decision, recorded
with the enable signals that could drive it.

WHAT IS DECIDED, AND WHAT IS NOT
================================
    DECIDED    the pad inventory of every ingested slot, by role, by counting
               the operator's own per-side pad instance lists
    DECIDED    the design's declared top-level signal-bit count
    DECIDED    fits / does not fit / does not fit but has fold candidates
    NOT DECIDED whether a fold candidate is protocol-safe
    NOT DECIDED anything about area, timing or routability -- a design can fit
               the pads and still not fit the die

VERDICTS AND EXIT CODES
=======================
    FITS               rc 0   the declared interface fits a slot as declared
    FITS_AFTER_FOLD    rc 0   fits only if a named fold is taken; the fold is
                              NOT applied here and the candidates are listed
    DOES_NOT_FIT       rc 1   no slot can bond it, even after folding every
                              same-width in/out pair -- with the shortfall
    UNDECIDED          rc 2   no slots ingested, or no port list could be read.
                              A question that could not be asked has not passed.
    (usage error)      rc 3   the COMMAND LINE was rejected -- an unknown flag,
                              a missing positional, a `--param` value that is
                              not an integer, or a `--json` destination that
                              climbs out of the project. NOTHING was examined,
                              and that is a verdict about the CALLER, not about
                              the design.

rc 2 is the flow's "could not measure" tier. It is NEVER returned for a design
that simply does not fit: that is an answer, and it is rc 1.

rc 3 AND rc 2 ARE DIFFERENT ON PURPOSE (#712). argparse exits 2 by default, and
2 is the vacuous tier here, so a mistyped invocation would have reported "I
examined nothing" -- indistinguishable from the honest skip a cell/IP design
gets. `_gate_usage_exit.GateArgumentParser` moves it to 3, which the flow reads
as a FAIL rather than folding into a pass. `--help` still exits 0: that is a
successful invocation and must not read as a failure to a wrapper.

Chip-, PDK-, operator- and vendor-AGNOSTIC. Every number comes from the ingested
slot files and the design's own RTL at runtime. No slot geometry, pad count,
cell name or design identifier is written into this file.

    """Verilog comments removed in ONE left-to-right pass.

    WHY A PASS AND NOT TWO SUBSTITUTIONS (vibe-ic#731)
    --------------------------------------------------
    This was `re.sub("//[^\\n]*")` followed by `re.sub("/\\*.*?\\*/")`. Two
    independent passes cannot express the one rule Verilog actually has:
    whichever introducer opens FIRST owns the text after it. The `//` pass
    runs with no idea a block comment is open, so a `*/` that happens to sit
    behind a `//` is deleted with the line that carries it -- and the block
    comment it terminated then has no terminator left for the second pass to
    find, so the whole block survives into the scanned text.

    MEASURED, on legal Verilog whose real ports are exactly `clk` and `done`:

        input wire clk,   /* disabled,
        output wire phantom,
        // end of the disabled block */
        output wire done

    `phantom` is inside the block comment and does not exist. The two-pass
    strip minted it as an output and counted its bit in the pad budget. That
    is this gate's own founding defect -- a comment sentence minting a
    declaration that is not there -- one level in, and it lands on the number
    the budget verdict is computed from.

    It cuts the other way too, which is the direction that matters more: the
    same orphaned block glues itself to the front of the NEXT real port, the
    chunk no longer starts with a direction keyword, and the port is dropped.
    A dropped port is a smaller interface, and a smaller interface is how a
    design that does not fit its slot reads as FITS.

    Line geometry is preserved -- a block comment is replaced by the newlines
    it spanned -- because the conditional-compilation scan below is
    line-oriented and counts `ifdef`/`endif` nesting by line.

    HONEST LIMIT: string literals are not tracked, so a `//` inside a string
    opens a comment here. That is inherited from the two-pass form this
    replaces, it cannot affect an ANSI port list (which admits no string
    literal), and naming it is better than a lexer this file does not need.

    WHY THE PROGRAM GLOBS AND NOT THE GATE CLAUSE (vibe-ic#1347)
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    The obvious wiring is `--rtl phase2/stage1/rtl/*.v` in the flow clause.
    It is a trap. `flow_compliance_check._resolve_program_cmd` expands globs
    in a clause into SEPARATE argv tokens, `--rtl` consumes exactly one, and
    every remaining file arrives as an extra positional, which is rejected.

    THE TRAP WAS SILENT AND IS NOW LOUD, and both halves are worth keeping.
    Until this program adopted the rc-3 usage tier (#712), that rejection was
    argparse's default **exit 2** -- this flow's VACUOUS_PASS -- so the gate
    would have reported a disclosed skip on every multi-file design, forever,
    looking exactly like the ordinary "no slots ingested" one. It is rc 3 now,
    which the flow reads as FAIL, so the same mistake breaks the step visibly.

    The clause still carries no glob: a loud break is still a break. The
    expansion happens here instead, where a directory that does not exist is an
    ANSWER (`[]` -> rc 2 UNDECIDED with a reason naming the directory) and not
    a usage error at all.
