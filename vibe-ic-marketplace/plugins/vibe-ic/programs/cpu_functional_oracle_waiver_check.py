"""cpu_functional_oracle_waiver_check.py — legacy-named Step-4 functional
evidence requirement.

ENFORCEMENT: blocking. A completed connectivity simulation is useful
structural evidence, but it is not a functional oracle and cannot release
Step 4. The runner still records the connectivity result verbatim
(``CONNECTIVITY_PASS``, ``functional_verified=false`` and its transcript
pointer); this gate now reports that state as ``INCOMPLETE`` and exits 1.

Program-first routing is explicit: ``professional_tb_gen`` generates and runs
the self-checking oracle first. A class whose reference semantics are not
deterministically derivable is handed to the shipped ``testbench-gen`` expert
fallback to fill the reference hook and re-run it. Missing semantics are work
to close, never a class waiver. The filename is retained for compatibility
with shipped flow definitions and old reports; it no longer grants a waiver.

Verdicts / exit codes (chip-AGNOSTIC — project artifacts only):
  0 = N/A for this gate: sim/results.xml is a genuine functional PASS (an
      oracle / non-connectivity verdict). This gate makes no claim about it;
      the existing functional gates own it.  (Also 0 when no connectivity
      marker is present at all and the verdict is a plain functional PASS.)
  2 = VACUOUS: no sim/results.xml at all — nothing for this gate to assess
      (the absence is the standard missing-file FAIL the files_exist gate
      reports; this gate stays out of the way).
      OR NOT_MEASURED [EXTERNAL] (FX_P2): every case that could run ran and
      passed, and some declared case could not run because the design input
      supplies no stimulus for it (`testbench_gen.case_input_gap`). The JSON
      report says verdict NOT_MEASURED, reason_class EXTERNAL, and names each
      case and what is missing. Never a PASS, never a FAIL.
  1 = INCOMPLETE when a substantiated connectivity-only run exists without a
      real professional/oracle result; FAIL when the bridge evidence is forged
      or broken. Both are blocking and neither is a waiver.

# `kind: "verification_checklist"`, harvested by Phase 1 from the vendor's DV
# CHECKLIST — rows named `spec_complete`, `csr_defined`, `clkrst_connected`,
# whose stimulus is the literal string "DV checklist item SPEC_COMPLETE — Done"

#
# Nothing can drive those. There is no stimulus and no expected VALUE in any
# circuit sense; they record that a project reached a milestone. The unit-TB
# producer was RIGHT to place 0 of 103 in its scaffold scope — the defect was
# never that the tests do not run, it is that a project-management checklist
# was counted as a test-case population, so the gate demanded execution of 103
# things that can never be executed and reported a shortfall that was
# arithmetic, not evidence.
#
# They are still REPORTED, under their own key, so a reader sees what the input
# declared and why it is not in the executable denominator. This NARROWS a

        PASS: the record's functional_verified=true is SUBSTANTIATED by
        .../l10_unit_tb/results.xml: tests=10 passed=10 failures=0 errors=0

    while NINE of those ten cases never executed an oracle at all. The nine
    testbenches exist and are green, but each is the SUBSTANCE FLOOR the
    generator writes when no oracle is derivable: it asserts only that no
    output stays X/Z after reset, and says so in machine-readable form with
    `VIBEIC_TB_ORACLE: NONE (substance floor only)`. Ten scaffolds that check
    almost nothing produce ten green JUnit rows, and a row count reads them as
    ten verified functions. The single real oracle was
    `reset_n_cycle_instruction` (reset-to-first-bus-activity latency). A CPU
    whose instruction set was never exercised stood one gate away from a
    published PASS.

    So the JUnit predicate stops being SUFFICIENT. It stays NECESSARY — a
    failing, vacuous or unresolvable transcript is refused exactly where it
    always was — and this adds the question the transcript cannot answer: did
    the declared case's own oracle RUN?

    module `professional_tb_check` and `l10_tb_conformance_check` consult, and
    it is fail-closed by construction: a missing record, an unreadable one, a
    schema mismatch, a case absent from the record, or a row whose verdict is
    not backed by `sim_executed=true` are each NOT_EXECUTED, never a silent
    pass. A second reader here would be a second answer waiting to disagree
