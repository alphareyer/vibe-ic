"""Verify metal fill was inserted, and judge any PER-LAYER density it carries.

WHAT THIS GATE DOES AND DOES NOT MEASURE
----------------------------------------
It reads the fill artefacts (filled.def / metal_fill.done) and the fill
emitter's own reports/density.{json,rpt}, and it substantiates that the fill
achieved SOMETHING (fillers placed, or the DEF grew, or rows were already
full, or an attested sparse-die skip).

A BYTE-IDENTICAL filled.def is judged separately and more strictly, ABOVE that
ladder (#364): nothing was emitted, so no signal from the ladder may excuse it.
The only two exemptions are an ATTESTED sparse-die skip (#684) and fill that was
already inserted at PnR — and the second requires fill cells MEASURED PRESENT in
the routed.def baseline, not merely a high row utilization, because row-util
counts logic and fill together and so cannot tell "already filled" from "never
filled". See the §4.05 note at the check itself.

The foundry's per-LAYER CMP density window is a different measurement, and
this gate applies it only when the density artefact actually carries per-layer
numbers. The OpenROAD filler_placement report normally does NOT: it carries
row/core utilization, which is not metal density. The summary used to report
``density_checked: true`` for that case — true only in the sense that a file
was opened — so a run in which not one per-layer density value was ever
examined read as though the density rule had been verified. Measured on the
real spm x ihp-sg13g2 run: layers_ok=0, layers_bad=0, pass=true, and
``density_checked: true``. The summary now says both things separately
(``density_artefact_read`` vs ``per_layer_density_verified``) and states, in a
NAMED INFO finding, who does judge the per-layer rule when this gate does not —
INCLUDING that today no flow gate does: `metal_layer_density_check` (the correct
judge of reports/phase3/metal_density.json) is reachable only through
`signoff_ladder_run`, which no flow step invokes. Wiring it is a separate,
measured change: over the 17 benchmark-data/ic project snapshots it resolves a
report on 10 and FAILs all 10 — 4 of them only against the DISCLOSED GENERIC
default window, because those runs declare no PDK. Making this step red on a
generic stand-in window is not a fix, so the CLAIM is corrected here and the
wiring is left to that change.

    # engineering decision, and (b) FILL ALREADY DONE AT PnR — when the
    # standard-cell filler ran DURING PnR (filler_placement runs after
    # detailed_route) the routed.def baseline ALREADY CARRIES the fill cells, so
    # a LATER standalone fill step correctly places 0 and emits a
    # byte-identical filled.def. Without (b), every design whose fill is
    # inserted at PnR-time (the common open-flow shape) FAILs the completion
    # audit despite being fully filled.
    #
    # §4.05 NO-LEAK — exemption (b) is a RELAXATION, so its evidence must be
    # the thing it claims, measured, and it is deliberately a CONJUNCTION:
    #
    #   * `rows_already_full` ALONE CANNOT CARRY IT. row_utilization_pct is
    #     computed by the runner as sum(area of every CORE*-class instance) /
    #     row area — LOGIC cells and FILL cells TOGETHER (phase3_one_shot_
    #     runner's odb block: `if {[string match "CORE*" [$_m getType]]}`).
    #     A densely-placed design with ZERO fill cells therefore also reads
    #     >= 95, so keying the exemption on row-util alone lets the one design
    #     class that most needs FILL_NOOP — dense rows, no fill ever inserted —
    #     pass while the gate ASSERTS "fill is present in the baseline". That
    #     is a claim the gate would never have checked. Reproduced as a
    #     negative control in test_v0_2_75_metal_fill_substance.
    #   * So the exemption ALSO requires fill cells to be MEASURED PRESENT in
    #     the routed.def baseline (baseline_fill_instance_count > 0), which is
    #     the direct evidence for "already filled" rather than a proxy for it.
    #   * NOT MEASURABLE IS NOT EXEMPT (fail-closed): an unreadable DEF or one
    #     with no COMPONENTS section returns None, not 0, and no exemption is
    #     granted.
