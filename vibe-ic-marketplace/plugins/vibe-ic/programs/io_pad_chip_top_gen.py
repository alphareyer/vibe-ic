"""io_pad_chip_top_gen — the PRODUCER of the chip-top that carries IO pads.

ENFORCEMENT: blocking — ``phase3_one_shot_runner`` invokes this program inline
BEFORE ``step_pad_ring_gen``. Its record is what makes the instance-keyed half
of declaration section 2B derivable; a refusal here leaves those questions
owed and step 15.5ic refuses exactly as it did before. This token names the
measured runner control path, not finding severity.

WHY THIS PROGRAM EXISTS
=======================
The chip path asked every design for a pad ring over instances NOTHING BUILT.
Measured on spm x gf180mcuD at plugin 1.15.67 (2026-09-02), with all eight
section-2B questions answered by hand::

    PAD_INSTANCE_NOT_IN_BLOCK: 36 ordered pad instance(s) are not COMPONENTS
    of phase3/stage3/pnr/floorplan.def -- the side variables name instances
    the netlist must already carry, and this step does not create them

`pad_assignment_gen`'s own docstring had already localised it: PAD_SOUTH /
PAD_EAST / PAD_NORTH / PAD_WEST and SIGNAL_MAP "are lists of NETLIST
INSTANCES", a document "partitions PORTS", and writing instance names for a
netlist that does not contain them "would be inventing the one thing this step
exists to refuse to invent". Both statements were correct and neither could be
acted on, because no step in the flow instantiated an IO cell. A grep over the
tree found the pad-cell masters named in exactly two places -- `bsdl_emit`'s
recogniser and a comment in `foundry_handoff_pack_gen` -- and in no producer.

So the SELF_TAPEOUT route could not be completed by ANY design arriving with
L-documents and a declaration. This program closes that, and it closes it by
DERIVING the instances rather than by relaxing the refusal: the instances it
names exist because it created them.

WHAT IT READS -- three sources, none of them a default
=====================================================
1. THE DESIGN'S OWN PARTITION, via `_l_doc_pad_placement`: which top-level
   PORT sits on which die edge, one entry per bus bit, in the document's own
   order. This is the same reader `pad_assignment_gen` already uses, so the
   partition this producer instantiates and the partition that program reports
   cannot disagree.
2. THE DESIGN'S PORT LIST AND DIRECTIONS, from `L9_INTEGRATION_SPEC.json`
   `top_ports`. Directions decide the pad CLASS; nothing here guesses a
   direction from a name.
3. THE IO CELL LIBRARY, via `_pad_ring.IoLibrary` and
   `_pad_ring.PdkDeclarations`: the masters and their LEF CLASS, the site
   names, the corner master, the fillers and the edge spacing. Read from the
   PDK the RUN selected -- a named tree that does not resolve is NOT RESOLVED,
   never a scan that would draw masters from an unrelated process.

MASTER SELECTION -- a stated rule, and it is recorded per port
==============================================================
An `input` port takes the narrowest ``CLASS PAD INPUT`` master; an `output` or
`inout` port takes the narrowest ``CLASS PAD INOUT`` master; ties break on the
master name so the choice is stable across runs and across filesystems. Where
a library ships no ``PAD INPUT`` at all -- sky130's does not, measured: its
IO LEFs carry 2 ``PAD INOUT`` and 0 ``PAD INPUT`` -- inputs fall back to
``PAD INOUT`` and the fallback is NAMED in the record, per port.

This is a choice, and it is legitimate here only because the design DELEGATED
it: `_l_doc_pad_placement` sets `delegates_io_library_to_pdk` when the design's
own document says the IO cell type is the PDK's to pick. A design that does
NOT delegate is refused rather than chosen for.

ROTATIONS -- library first, geometry second, basis always recorded
=================================================================
Where the IO library declares PAD_ROTATION_HORIZONTAL / _VERTICAL / _CORNER
they are adopted verbatim and the basis is `pdk_declaration` with the
`<file>:<line>` the declaration came from -- sky130_ef_io declares all three.
Where it does not -- gf180mcu_fd_io declares none, measured -- they are
derived from SIDE GEOMETRY by the rule this flow already states in
`_tapeout_declaration`: a pad row along a horizontal edge and a pad row along
a vertical edge differ by a quarter turn, "NORTH is SOUTH's half turn and each
corner is a further quarter turn". The basis is then `side_geometry` and the
rule is written into the record. A derived value is never reported as a
declared one.

WHAT IT WILL NOT DO
===================
* It will not invent a partition. No pad-placement section, an unresolved bus
  token, or a port the partition does not mention: REFUSE, naming it.
* It will not place a port twice, and it will not leave a top-level port
  padless -- both are refusals, because a chip-top that drops a port is a
  different design.
* It will not choose an IO library for a design that did not delegate one.
* It will not guess named power-pad masters or silently assume separate IO and
  core voltage domains.  When the caller supplies the PDN's already-derived
  power and ground rail names, it may derive the minimum electrically complete
  SAME-DOMAIN pair from ``CLASS PAD POWER`` and the LEF pins' ``USE`` roles.
  Every connection, source LEF and selection refusal is then recorded.  If the
  library cannot prove such a pair, it refuses instead of emitting a cosmetic
  ring whose supply is open.
* It will not leave an auxiliary IO control floating or disguise a signal pin
  as a power-grid terminal.  Liberty-derived 1/0 controls are driven by the
  active standard-cell library's own tie cells, supplied with their
  Liberty-derived output pins.  If a required tie cell is absent, the producer
  refuses instead of writing a wrapper whose logical record and routed
  connectivity disagree.

OUTPUTS
=======
``phase3/stage3/pnr/chip_top_io.v``   the chip-top: core instance, one pad
                                      instance per top-level port, ports
                                      renamed to the pad-side nets
``reports/phase3/io_pad_chip_top.json`` the record: per-port master and why,
                                      the per-side instance ORDER, the
                                      SIGNAL_MAP, the rotations with their
                                      basis, and every refusal

EXIT CODES
    0 = a chip-top and a complete derived record were written
    1 = refused; the record names the rule and nothing was written
    2 = the inputs this producer needs are absent (no partition, no port list,
        no IO library) -- NOT a defect in the design, and not a pass either

chip-AGNOSTIC: no design name, no PDK name and no master name appears in this
file. Every one is read from the project or the PDK tree the run selected.

    """How far from the pad edge the PDN ring must lie for pdngen to strap
    each supply cell to it.

    pdngen (`add_pdn_ring -connect_to_pads`) connects a supply pad with one
    strap per core-facing pin of the net the pad supplies: from the pin's far
    end, across the pad edge, to the far edge of that net's ring. The strap is
    as wide as the pin. MEASURED (subservient x gf180mcuD, OpenROAD
    26Q3-3002): pdngen keeps such a strap only when it is LONGER THAN IT IS
    WIDE. It reads a strap's direction from its aspect ratio, so a shorter
    strap counts as running along the edge, the pad's own obstruction at its
    pad end is stretched over all of it, and it is cut away (vibeic/OpenROAD
    #33). The ground cell's pins are 1.0 um deep and 9.5-10.25 um wide; its
    straps were 8.82 um (west) and 8.9 um (north, a 2412 um die) long and the
    core's ground grid was left without a source (PSM-0069). With the ring
    8 um further out the same cell connected on every edge, and the power
    cell (4.655 um pins) connected on every edge either way. The routing
    direction of the pin's layer does not decide it.

    So a strap needs `pin depth + pad-edge-to-ring-far-edge > pin width`, and
    this returns, per cell and per edge, `reach_um = pin width - pin depth`:
    the distance the ring's far edge must lie beyond the pad edge. Only the
    pins on the net the cell supplies count (pdngen builds its straps per
    ITerm, so an opposite-polarity ESD pin never sources this net), and only
    on the declared pad-connect layers when they are given. `reach_um` is
    the largest over the pair; the runner reserves it in the core inset.
    Pin geometry and cell size come from the IO LEF; nothing is named.

    # 355 um corners, `PAD_RING_DOES_NOT_FIT` on all four sides at once.
    #
    # Per side: the two corner cells plus every pad on that side, at the
    # master's own LEF width. The die is the LARGEST side, so the ring closes
    # on all four; the remainder on the shorter sides is what the declared
    # fillers exist to close. Rounded UP to a whole micron -- never down,
    # because a die that is 0.4 um short is a ring that does not abut.
    # THE EDGE SPACING IS PART OF THE DIE AND WAS MISSING FROM THIS SUM.

    # sized without the edge term is therefore short by exactly twice it, and
    # the refusal that produced reads like a pad-ring defect. MEASURED on
    # spm x gf180mcuD after the corner term was added and before this one:
    #     PAD_NORTH: the sum of cell widths is 4800000 DEF unit(s) and the
    #     side is 4696000 -- 104000 unit(s) wider than the declared die
    # 104000 units at 2000 units/um is 52 um, which is 2 x the library's own
    # declared PAD_EDGE_SPACING of 26. The term is read from the same
    # declaration `pad_assignment_gen` writes into the config, so the two
    # cannot disagree; a library that declares none contributes 0, which is
    # what upstream's own default for that variable is.
