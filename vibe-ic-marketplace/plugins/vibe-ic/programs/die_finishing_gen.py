"""die_finishing_gen.py — Step 26.5ic producer: the PDK's own seal ring, and
the die-identification half's honest state.

WHAT GAP THIS CLOSES
--------------------
The flow had no chip-finishing track. It streamed a die out and signed it off
with no seal ring, and nothing anywhere said so. MEASURED 2026-08-19, by the
external authority rather than by this repo's own opinion: wafer.space's
precheck container, run against a GDS this flow published, refused at stage 3
of 16 —

    [Error]: Layer 'GUARD_RING_MK' is not used.
             wafers.space requires a seal ring (guard ring) around the die.

Stages 4-16 had never executed, so nothing downstream of that line was known
about any die this flow has ever produced.

TWO HALVES, TWO SOURCES, NEVER ONE VERDICT
-------------------------------------------
Step 26.5ic is die FINISHING, not just the ring:

  seal ring   the PDK ships its own generator and this program CALLS it. It
              contains no ring geometry: width, layer stack, corner
              construction and slot pattern are foundry data. A PDK that ships
              no generator is a NAMED disclosed skip, mirroring LibreLane's
              `KLayout.SealRing`, which says "KLAYOUT_SEALRING_SCRIPT is
              unset ... This step will be skipped" rather than pretending.
  die id      four shuttle-owned cells whose provenance is NOT YET DETERMINED.
              Until it is, this half reports NOT_DETERMINED — it must not
              report clean, and it must not fail the seal ring for its own
              absence. The two states are written to separate keys of the
              report so no consumer can average them.

WHY THE VERDICT IS A MEASUREMENT, NOT AN EXIT CODE
--------------------------------------------------
MEASURED on the gf180mcuD PDK shipped in this project's EDA image: the PDK's
own `sealring.py` is present, but the PCell library it imports is not shipped
in that PDK version. The script prints "Error: Couldn't load the seal ring
library." and calls `sys.exit()` with no argument — so it exits **0** and
writes **no output file**. Trusting the exit status would have recorded a seal
ring that does not exist, on a PDK that ships the script. So the ring is
verified by diffing the layouts (`sealring/sealring_verify.py`) and the exit
code is only ever additional evidence.

WHAT IS TAKEN FROM UPSTREAM, AND WHERE THIS GOES FURTHER
--------------------------------------------------------
Read out of `librelane/steps/klayout.py` in the pinned image, not remembered:

  TAKEN  the interface. `KLayout.SealRing.run_generic` is exactly
         `python3 <KLAYOUT_SEALRING_SCRIPT> --input <gds> --output <gds>
         --die-width <X span> --die-height <Y span>` with PDK_ROOT and PDK in
         the environment. Four flags; that is the whole contract, and this
         program uses it unchanged. (To vibeic-eda 0.3.79 upstream passed
         DIE_AREA[2]/[3], the far corner, equal to the spans only for a die at
         the origin; from 0.3.83 it passes x1-x0 / y1-y0, which `die_size`
         here always computed.)
  NOT TAKEN (reported) upstream's corner move. From 0.3.83, for a die NOT at
         the origin upstream moves what the script drew to DIE_AREA's
         lower-left (`place_sealring.py`; `offset_x/offset_y` on its second
         path). This program does not: the script draws from (0,0). Every
         DIEAREA in the published corpus is at (0,0) (3 of 3, measured
         2026-09-28), so it has not been exercised, and the ring verifier is
         what would see a ring drawn off the die.
  TAKEN  the skip. Upstream: "KLAYOUT_SEALRING_SCRIPT is unset.
         KLayout.SealRing may not be supported for the {PDK} PDK. This step
         will be skipped." Same shape here, PDK named, plus the list of
         locations searched — "unset" is only checkable if the reader is told
         where it was looked for.
  TAKEN  the second code path. `run_ihp_sg13g2` drives the script as a KLayout
         batch job and additionally sets KLAYOUT_PATH so the technology
         definition loads. Both are reproduced, KLAYOUT_PATH included.
  TAKEN  generator and checker are SEPARATE, and the checker is what fails the
         flow (upstream: KLayout.Density then Checker.KLayoutDensity). This
         program only produces; `die_finishing_check` is the gate.

  BETTER upstream selects between its two paths by PDK NAME. This program reads
         the interface the script itself DECLARES (does it accept
         `--die-width`?), so a PDK that is renamed, forked or vendored under a
         different name is still driven correctly, and a PDK nobody wrote a
         branch for is driven correctly the first time. MEASURED on the two PDK
         scripts in the pinned image: the option appears once in the pya-cli
         one and zero times in the KLayout-batch one.
  BETTER upstream derives the KLayout technology name by string-editing the PDK
         name. This reads `<name>` out of the PDK's own `.lyt`, which is the
         authority that owns it, and REFUSES when a PDK ships more than one
         rather than guessing.
  BETTER upstream emits NO METRIC. `KLayout.SealRing.run` and both of its
         branches return an empty MetricsUpdate — three `return views_updates,
         {}` in the class — so a LibreLane run cannot tell a die that was
         sealed from a die whose PDK had no script, and neither can its
         reports. This program writes reports/phase3/die_finishing.json on
         every path, with the seal-ring and die-identification halves in
         separate keys.
  BETTER upstream trusts the script's exit status. The measured gf180mcuD case
         below exits 0 having written nothing; this program diffs the layouts.

  ABSENT UPSTREAM, reported as a finding rather than searched for further:
         LibreLane has no die-identification step at all, and no shuttle
         precheck. The die-id cells are the SHUTTLE's, not the PDK's and not
         LibreLane's, so there is nothing upstream to copy for that half — which
         is part of why it is NOT_DETERMINED rather than merely unimplemented.

WHEN IT DOES NOT RUN AT ALL. A seal ring is a DIE structure, and so is the
die-level marker layer the generator draws it under. When the design's own
declaration answers `deliverable=HARDMACRO` this step is SKIPPED BY THAT
DECLARATION, recorded and named — the parent die the macro is placed in owns
its ring and its markers. See `_hardmacro_skip` for the measurement that made
this explicit (vibe-ic#2112).

WHERE IT RUNS. At stream-out, after the layer merge and BEFORE the fill passes,
the density checks and the sign-off DRC/LVS consume the GDS — LibreLane's own
chip-flow order (SealRing -> Filler -> Density). Adding the ring after Step 31
would mean the die Step 31 verified is not the die that ships.

chip/PDK-AGNOSTIC: the script path, the invocation form, the technology name,
the guard-ring marker layer and the die-id cell list are all INPUTS. No
foundry, PDK, vendor or design literal appears here.

    The config is not the only place this can be settled. MEASURED on spm run20:
    `L1_DATASHEET.json` carries `package_info: null` AND
    `no_package_in_input: true`, and the step-0.5ic / operator answers carry a
    typed `absent_reason` -- "nothing in L1-L9 names an operator, a slot, a
    submission template or a package" -- with an absence-of-evidence citation.
    That is an ANSWER, and reading it as silence is the mistake #2118 cost:
    a declared absence is not a missing declaration.

    By this function's own table below, `packaging declared and not CoB` is
    NOT_APPLICABLE. A design that declares it has no package is declared and not
    CoB, so the half settles as NOT_APPLICABLE instead of sitting NOT_DETERMINED
    forever -- which is what tiered the whole `die_finishing` document INCOMPLETE
    while its own verdict said PASS and its own reason said the die-ID half "does
    not gate the seal ring".

    Returns the citation when the design declares no package, else None. Only a
    POSITIVE declaration counts: an absent or unreadable L1, or one that simply
    omits the keys, returns None and the half stays NOT_DETERMINED.

    """The die-identification half, reported SEPARATELY and CONDITIONALLY.

    THE CONDITION IS THE WHOLE POINT, and it was measured on the operator's own
    tool. In `generate_id.py` the entire four-cell requirement sits behind
    `if cob:`, and `--cob` is `action="store_true"` — default OFF. So:

      * a CHIP-ON-BOARD submission is hard-blocked without the four cells;
      * a non-CoB submission passes the shuttle's precheck with none of them,
        and the operator's own script is a silent no-op on it.

    An UNCONDITIONAL gate here would therefore refuse correct non-CoB designs,
    and a gate that ignored the condition would credit a CoB design missing all
    four. Both are wrong, and the difference is a DECLARED INPUT — the
    packaging choice — which this flow does not yet carry anywhere. So the
    report always says WHICH CASE IT WAS IN:

      packaging = CoB, cells all present once   -> PRESENT
      packaging = CoB, any missing or duplicated-> ABSENT   (a real FAIL)
      packaging = CoB, no cell list declared    -> NOT_DETERMINED
      packaging declared and not CoB            -> NOT_APPLICABLE
      packaging not declared                    -> NOT_DETERMINED

    NOT_APPLICABLE and NOT_DETERMINED are deliberately neither PASS nor FAIL,
    and NEITHER may take a verified seal ring down with it. The cells
    themselves are the operator's, shipped pre-built by its project template —
    not the PDK's, not LibreLane's, and not this repository's to generate — so
    the cell list stays a declared input and nothing here invents one.
