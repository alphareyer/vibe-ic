"""_a6_drc_authority.py — whose word stands for an A6 DRC rule (q1, T109).

A6 runs two engines on an analog block: the PDK's KLayout sign-off decks and
Magic. They disagree, and until this module the disagreement was settled by
which rules the ONE KLayout deck that ran happened to grade. On ihp-sg13g2
that deck (`ihp-sg13g2.drc`, the "main" table) grades neither `MIM.e` nor
`M2.d`; both live only in the PDK's extra-rules deck
(`rule_decks/sg13g2_maximal.drc`), which IHP's own `run_drc.py` runs by
default and neither A6 arm ran. So Magic's `MIM.e` on the GDS was blocking
with no engine to contradict it, and its `M2.d` was excused as the PDK's own
gencell with no engine to confirm it.

THE AUTHORITY RULE (owner decision q1, 2026-09-26)
  * The PDK's KLayout decks — the main runset AND every extra runset the PDK
    ships beside it (`rule_decks/*_maximal.drc`, found by glob, never by a
    literal name: it is `sg13cmos5l_maximal.drc` on ihp-sg13cmos5l) — are
    authoritative for every rule EITHER deck grades. Anything they fire on the
    block GDS is a FAIL, inside a PDK device cell or not: the foundry deck
    will see it too, so `DEVICE_CELL` no longer excuses it.
  * Magic is authoritative only for rules NEITHER deck grades.
  * Deferring a rule the two engines DISAGREE on (Magic fires, the deck graded
    it and fired 0) needs a CAPABILITY CONTROL: the same deck must fire that
    rule on the PDK's own unit FAIL testcase
    (`testing/testcases/unit/*.gds`, matched by the rule labels the testcase
    carries). Without it the rule blocks as
    `A6_ENGINE_DISAGREEMENT_UNCONTROLLED` — a deck that cannot fire a rule
    proves nothing by not firing it.
  * `ENGINE_ARTEFACT` names a deferred rule for which all four hold: the
    violation is Magic-only; it reproduces, rectangle for rectangle, on the
    bare device's own GDS round trip; the authoritative deck reports 0 for it
    on that device GDS and on the block GDS; and the capability control
    passed. It is excused and ALWAYS reported.

Nothing here names a rule, a layer or a PDK: the join key is the rule id the
PDK itself writes in both engines' output. chip-AGNOSTIC.
