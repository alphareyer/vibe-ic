"""analog_incremental_resolution.py — what resolution an INCREMENTAL loop can
actually reach, MEASURED on its own recurrence.

CHIP_AGNOSTIC: strict-logic

WHY THIS EXISTS. An incremental converter's textbook ceiling is
`log2(N(N-1)/2)` at order 2 — 14.994 at N=256, 16.997 at N=512. A generator
that sizes a loop against that number sizes it against a bound the loop does
not reach: measured on the recurrence the emitter actually emits, with the
matched decode and a coherent in-band tone, N=256 order 2 reaches **10.68 bit**
and N=512 reaches **12.75** (lane icadc, F168). The 4.3-bit shortfall is not
noise and not the tone's position — a HELD input reads the same to 0.2 bit —
it is the loop.

So a choice between two oversampling ratios, or between two loop orders, or
between a delaying and a delay-free feedback branch, cannot be made from the
closed form. It is made HERE, by running the recurrence.

WHAT IT RUNS, AND WHY THAT IS NOT A SIMULATION. The model is the same
difference equation `analog_incremental_decimator` derives its weights from,
with the same per-stage coefficient and the same feedback delay:

    v[n]   = +1 if I_last > 0 else -1          (a 1-bit quantiser)
    I_s[n] = I_s[n-1] + a * (I_{s-1}[n-1] - d[n])
    I_0[n] = I_0[n-1] + a * (u[n]         - d[n])
    d[n]   = v[n - feedback_delay]

Arithmetic only: no device, no PDK, no simulator. It answers "what can this
RECURRENCE resolve", which is the ceiling every device below it is then held
to — never "what does this circuit do".

WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, AND IT COST A COMMIT TO FIND OUT. The model treats each
integrator as a STATE HELD BETWEEN STEPS, so it will happily tell you that a
decision taken "in step n" beats one taken "in step n-1" — it has no notion of
WHICH PHYSICAL INSTANT inside a clock period a decision is taken at. The
circuit does. MEASURED on the emitted deck (lane icadc, R-0915-81): the last
integrator's output is flat to 0.2 mV for the whole CHARGE-TRANSFER phase
(-0.01240, -0.01223, -0.01223, -0.01222 V from the common mode across 440 ns)
and wanders over 270 mV during the SAMPLING phase (+0.148, +0.193, -0.081,
-0.061, +0.023, -0.029). A model that says "move the decision earlier by one
step" is describing a node that, at that instant, is not holding a value.

So this module chooses between things a DIFFERENCE EQUATION can distinguish —
how many clocks a window holds, how many integrators, what coefficient — and
NOT between things only a waveform can. On the one occasion it was asked to,
it preferred a delay-free loop by 1.5 bit and the harness measured the same
change at MINUS 7.4. Its preference for a smaller feedback delay is recorded
here as a known blind spot rather than removed, because the delay is still a
real input to the WEIGHTS and the model must run the loop it is decoding.

IT REPORTS THE EXCURSION WITH THE BITS, and that is load-bearing: a
coefficient that resolves better by driving the integrators past the supply
has not resolved better, it has clipped. `peak_per_stage` is in units of the
half reference span, so the declared budget
`integrator_swing_fraction_of_vdd * vdd / 2 / (vref / 2)` is directly
comparable. MEASURED: at a feedback delay of 1 the SECOND integrator peaks at
2.95 for a=0.25 and 74.6 for a=0.5; at delay 0, at 0.74 and 3.49. The delay is
what forces the small coefficient.

THE TONE IS COPRIME WITH THE WINDOWS, from `analog_resolution_stimulus`'s own
rule and never a second copy: a tone whose period in conversion windows is a
small integer makes the loop's deterministic error a component at the SIGNAL's
frequency, where an SNDR removes it as signal, and the instrument then reads
the worst placement as the best (vibe-ic F167).

AND IT IS SCORED WITHOUT A SPECTRUM. The decoded value is compared against the
INPUT-WEIGHTED truth — the same input weights the decode normalises by, so the
comparison is against what the loop was actually asked to average — and the
resolution is `-log2(2 * rms)` against full scale. No bin is excluded, so no
error can hide at the signal's own frequency by construction rather than by
luck.

No chip / SKU / foundry literal.

# ══ THE SWING MODEL, PER STAGE (q6-a2-cap-osr) ═════════════════════════════
#
# WHY THE SCALAR RECURRENCE ABOVE CANNOT JUDGE SWING. `_run` ties the input,
# inter-stage and DAC coefficients of every stage to ONE number, while the
# emitted circuit has separate `cs_i`, `cf_i` and `ci_i` devices. So it cannot
# express the one transformation that fixes swing — diagonal state scaling
# (Schreier's `scaleABCD`: x' = S x, which takes no OSR argument) — and its
# verdict "over the swing budget at every OSR" was a MODEL defect, not an OSR
# property: MEASURED on this recurrence, the peaks at DC inputs up to 0.92 are
# identical at N = 64 and N = 512, and scaling stage i by k leaves the
# bitstream bit-identical while multiplying that stage's peak by exactly k.
#
# The generalised loop, in units of the HALF reference span:
#
#     x_1[n] = x_1[n-1] + b_1 * u[n]      - a_1 * d[n] + o_1
#     x_s[n] = x_s[n-1] + c_s * x_{s-1}   - a_s * d[n] + o_s
#     v[n]   = +1 if x_last > 0 else -1 ;  d[n] = v[n - feedback_delay]
#
# with `b_1`, `a_s`, `c_s` and the per-clock offsets `o_s` MEASURED on the
# emitted netlist (`analog_sc_loop_probe`), never taken from the capacitor
# ratios alone: on u_hawaii_adc the DAC branch measured 0.2494 against a cap
# ratio of 0.2499, and the input branch 0.2686 against the SAME ratio — a
# branch without bottom-plate sampling takes signal-dependent charge
# injection, which no ratio shows.

    disclosed, as the capacitor ratios when no measurement exists).
    `b1_over_a1_per_cap_ratio` is the MEASURED input-branch gain relative to
    its capacitor ratio, (b1/a1)_meas / (cs1/cf1): 1.0 for a branch that
    realises its ratio, 1.077 measured on a branch without bottom-plate
    sampling. `offset_u` is the per-clock offset referred to the input, in
    units of the loop's full scale.

    1. u_stable: the largest input at which the loop's peaks do not grow with
       N (`stable_input_limit`).
    2. The effective full-scale input must keep `margin_u` below it:
       u_eff_max = (b1/a1) * u_decl + |offset_u| <= u_stable - margin_u.
       That fixes b1/a1, and the DRAWN ratio cs1/cf1 = (b1/a1) / gain.
