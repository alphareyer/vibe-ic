"""_ppa/power.py — the power split, and the thing that makes a power number
mean anything: WHERE THE ACTIVITY CAME FROM.

Spec §7.2. Owns exactly one question: given a power artefact, what are the
internal / switching / leakage / total figures, and on what ACTIVITY BASIS were
they computed. Nothing here decides a verdict against a threshold — that is the
gate's job (`power_total_vs_budget_check`), and keeping the two apart is why
adding a second power engine will not change a single rule.

WHY THE BASIS IS NOT A FOOTNOTE
===============================
A vectorless estimate and a VCD-driven measurement are both "total power" and
they are not the same number. `PPA_INTERFACES.md` §2 says so in one line —
"Vectorless power and VCD power are different metrics" — and the consequence is
the whole of this module: two power records whose activity basis differs are
NOT COMPARABLE, and a comparison across them is UNDETERMINED, never a winner.
The failure mode this prevents is the cheapest possible win: run the candidate
vectorless, run the baseline against a VCD, and report an improvement that is
an artefact of the activity model.

AND A DECLARED BASIS IS A CLAIM, NOT EVIDENCE
=============================================
MEASURED on the published corpus 2026-08-21, all 17 runs carrying a power
report:

    POWER_ANALYSIS_MODE absent           6
    POWER_ANALYSIS_MODE: vectorless_sdc  3
    POWER_ANALYSIS_MODE: vector_vcd      8

and every one of those 8 is contradicted by its OWN transcript — 5 carry
``READ_VCD_FAIL: ...`` from the `catch` around `read_power_activities`, and 3
carry OpenSTA's own count, ``Annotated 0 pin activities.``. Zero published power
numbers in this repository are vector-driven; eight of them say they are. The
label is written by the runner from the mere EXISTENCE of a `.vcd` file, before
the read is attempted, and the read failure is caught and printed rather than
raised — so `vector_vcd` in these files records an intention.

Therefore this module never takes the declared mode as the answer. It reads the
mode, then reads the evidence that would corroborate or falsify it, and returns
a basis with the corroboration state attached. A vector basis contradicted by
its own transcript is `CONTRADICTED`, the record is `INVALID` per §2, and an
INVALID record may not enter a numeric comparison. That is a REFUSAL, not a
reclassification: this module will not silently re-label such a run
"vectorless", because what the tool actually did with zero annotated activities
is a claim about OpenSTA's fallback that this repository has not measured.

WHAT AN ABSENT BASIS IS
=======================
`UNSTATED`, and UNSTATED is not comparable with anything — INCLUDING another
UNSTATED. Two numbers whose activity models are both unknown are not known to
share an activity model. Treating "unknown == unknown" as a match is exactly
the numeric-sentinel defect §2 forbids, one level up: it turns "not measured"
into a value that participates in arithmetic.

IR DROP IS NOT TOTAL POWER
==========================
Nothing here reads an IR-drop artefact. Peak-current and voltage-droop belong
to power integrity (`ir_drop_*`, `em_peak_current_authority_check`) and answer
a different question; a per-net total power stated by an IR engine on a
different netlist view is a different metric with a different scope and must not
be folded into this axis. On the corpus the two already differ by 4.3x at
baseline, so any tolerance wide enough to reconcile them would be a ruler
fitted to the data.

# artefact of the run said so.

# statement ABOUT a number, so a record may not carry one without carrying the
# other. When the report yields no total, this writer does not downgrade the
# claim and it does not invent a zero -- it declines to state a verdict at
# all and says, by name, that nothing was measured and why.
