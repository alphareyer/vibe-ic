"""Area: the taxonomy that keeps a PROXY and a PHYSICAL number apart.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS, AS A MEASUREMENT AND NOT AS AN OPINION
--------------------------------------------------------------
On one real completed run (`spm`, gf180mcuD, phase 3 complete) the three numbers
that all get called "the area" are:

    synthesis chip area   4703.5296   library area units, PRE-placement
    post-route core area  12294       um^2   (OpenROAD, post metal fill)
    die area              20164.00    um^2   (DEF DIEAREA 142.0 x 142.0 um)

The synthesis figure is 2.61x smaller than the core and 4.29x smaller than the
die, and it is not even in the same unit — the emitting artefact literally
declares `chip_area_unit: "cell-library area unit (as declared by the library
the synthesis script loaded)"`. So substituting one for the other is not an
approximation with an error bar. It is a different quantity, reported under the
same word.

The taxonomy therefore has three classes, and only one of them may ever answer
"how big is this chip":

    RTL_PROXY     cell count, wire count, and the reductions computed from them.
                  Counts, not extents. A count says nothing about the area of
                  what is fabricated: two netlists with the same cell count can
                  differ by any factor once drive strengths differ.
    SYNTH_PROXY   an AREA-shaped number produced before placement — yosys
                  `Chip area for module`, its sequential share. It has an area
                  unit, which is exactly what makes it dangerous: it looks
                  physical. It excludes placement density, filler, routing-driven
                  upsizing, the seal, and the die envelope.
    PHYSICAL      core area, die area, occupied standard-cell area, macro area,
                  utilisation — post-route, from the artefacts that exist.

`eligible_for_physical_ppa` is true for PHYSICAL and false for both proxies.
There is no metric for which it is conditionally true, because a conditional
would be the substitution this module exists to prevent.

THE RULE THAT IS THE POINT OF THE WHOLE FILE
--------------------------------------------
    A proxy comparison can never produce a SMALLER verdict.

Not "is down-weighted", not "is a tie-breaker": it cannot produce it at all. A
candidate that wins on cell count and loses on post-route core area is NOT
smaller, and a candidate that wins on cell count with no post-route evidence at
all is UNDETERMINED. `area_verdict` implements exactly that and its negative
fixture is that first sentence.

One more line runs alongside it, and it is not the same line: EXTENT vs RATIO.
`area.physical.utilization_pct` is PHYSICAL, post-route and measured, and it
still must not vote — a candidate at 40% where the baseline achieved 59.2% is
not a smaller chip, it is the same core with more empty space in it. So only
metrics that measure HOW BIG enter the verdict; the ones that measure WHAT
FRACTION are reported beside it and counted by nobody.

EXIT CODES (PPA_INTERFACES.md §1)
---------------------------------
    0 the physical evidence supports the smaller-area claim
    1 REFUSED — a finding about the design: it is not physically smaller
    2 UNDETERMINED — no physical evidence, mismatched scope, or absent input
    3 bad invocation

rc=1 is a claim about silicon. "I could not look" is 2 and prints a marker.

    made the core the 1176x1176 um interior, and `global_placement` was still
    handed `-density 0.30` -- the placement default, whose own help justifies it
    on a "spm 200x200 die". `-density` is an UPPER BOUND on bin occupancy, and
    the wirelength + timing objective packs right up to it, so on a core whose

# ── N4 — `--die-um auto` sizes the CORE from the cells this netlist HAS ─────
# MEASURED, spm x gf180mcuD as a HARDMACRO (lane cmpb, 2026-09-28, image
# 0.3.83): the auto-sizer took the mean cell to be `site area x 6.0` -- a
# sky130-hd width in sites -- so 2.195 um^2 x 6 = 13.17 um^2, where this
# netlist's own synthesis stat says 8857.632 um^2 / 273 cells = 32.4 um^2.
# It then made that area the DIE and cut a 10 um inset out of it: an 85 um die,
# a 65 um core, OpenROAD `Effective utilization: 2.193`, and a core narrower
# than one period of the PDK's own power straps. No per-PDK constant can be
# right for every library, so there is none here: the area is READ -- from the
# synthesis stat bound to this exact netlist, else from each instance's own LEF
# SIZE -- and when neither can be read the caller is told so.
