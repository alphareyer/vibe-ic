"""pg_supply_pin_ownership_check.py — every supply pin of every instance sits
on a DECLARED supply net of its own kind, read back from the DEF that ships.

THE DEFECT (TF24, measured). `step_signoff_spef_repair` re-opens `routed.def`
in a FRESH OpenROAD session, removes the fillers, runs `repair_design` /
`repair_timing -setup` / `repair_timing -hold`, re-routes, re-fills and writes
`routed_repaired.def`, which the step then PROMOTES over `routed.def`. The
PDN's `add_global_connection` rules are SESSION STATE: a DEF does not carry
them, so the fresh session had none, and `global_connect` never ran in it.
Every instance that session created kept its POWER/GROUND terminals on no net.

    spm x gf180mcuD, vibeic-eda 0.3.79, pure direct flow (lane mig98 arm D):
      routed_base_prerepair.def  VDD ( * VNW ) ( * VDD ) ( * DVDD ) — wildcards,
                                 every instance owned
      routed_repaired.def        VDD ( * DVDD ) + 13,045 explicit terminals;
                                 16 inserted `hold*` buffers and every
                                 re-inserted filler own NO supply terminal

and the LibreLane Netgen LVS on that DEF failed with 4 unmatched nets per such
buffer. A net pointer is what LVS netlists the cell's supply from, so this is a
real LVS and silicon defect, not bookkeeping.

WHAT THIS JUDGES. Nothing but the DEF and the LEFs that define its masters:

  * a pin is a SUPPLY PIN when its master's LEF types it `USE POWER` or
    `USE GROUND`;
  * a net is a DECLARED SUPPLY NET when the DEF itself types it `+ USE POWER`
    or `+ USE GROUND` (SPECIALNETS or NETS);
  * a supply pin is OWNED by the net that names it explicitly `( inst pin )`,
    else by the net that names its pin wildcard `( * pin )` — DEF's own rule;
  * PASS iff every supply pin of every instance is owned by a declared supply
    net OF THE SAME KIND (a POWER pin on a GROUND net is a short, not a pass).

Verdicts: PASS; FAIL with `PG_SUPPLY_PIN_OFF_SUPPLY_NET` (at least one supply
pin proven off its supply); NOT_MEASURED with
`PG_SUPPLY_OWNERSHIP_UNMEASURED` (no instance, no declared supply net, or an
instance whose master no LEF given defines — an unread master is unmeasured,
never clean). A proven FAIL outranks an unmeasured remainder.

SCOPE, stated so it cannot be misquoted: this is NET OWNERSHIP read from the
DEF, the same predicate `_build_pg_reconnect_tcl`'s in-session audit uses. It
is not a conductor test; whether metal reaches the pin is extraction's
question.

chip-AGNOSTIC: no PDK, cell, net or design literal. Every name comes from the
DEF and the LEFs handed in.
