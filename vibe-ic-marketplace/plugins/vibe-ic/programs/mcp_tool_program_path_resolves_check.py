"""mcp_tool_program_path_resolves_check.py — an MCP tool must be able to
REACH the program it spawns.

THE DEFECT THIS IS THE REGRESSION GUARD FOR
-------------------------------------------
One MCP tool handler built the path to its gate out of a path segment
naming a plugin edition this repo retired::

    const here = path.dirname(new URL(import.meta.url).pathname);
    const gate = path.resolve(here, "..", "..", <retired layout>,
                              "programs", "phase23_...check.py");

The resulting path existed in NEITHER shipped layout — not in the
installed-plugin tree, not in a repo checkout — so the handler never once
executed the program it is named after.  The tool had been registered,
advertised and documented the whole time.

WHAT THIS CHECKER DECIDES — ONE RULE, STATED AS A SCOPE
-------------------------------------------------------
A path expression is IN SCOPE when all EIGHT hold:

  1. It is built ONLY from string literals, template literals, ``+``
     concatenation and calls spelled ``join`` / ``resolve`` over them, plus
     identifiers this file can bind to a definite string (see BINDINGS).
     Anything else evaluates to UNKNOWN.  An expression that NAMES a
     program file literally is still COLLECTED when it cannot be evaluated
     — a call carrying the filename as its own argument
     (``_runPyProgram("gate.py")``, ``R(here, ..., "gate.py")`` after
     ``const {resolve: R} = path``), and a WRITE whose right-hand side
     holds one (``let g = dir + "/gate.py"``, ``{ gate: dir + "/gate.py"
     }``).  Rewriting the builder under another name, spelling the
     declaration with another keyword or none, or burying it in an object
     literal therefore moves the site into the printed undecided list
     instead of deleting it from the report.
  2. Its value ends in ``.py``.
  3. It is not one of SEVERAL program paths written into one list literal
     while a live alternative among them is still possible.  A list of
     paths is a list of ALTERNATIVES and a member that is absent is what
     such a list is written for; a list holding ONE path is a spawn's argv,
     and that one must exist.  When every alternative in a list is decided
     and every one is dead, the probe falls through on every machine and
     each member is judged on its own.
  4. It does not resolve back inside the MCP server's own source directory
     — that is the helper area the server manages, not the program set it
     spawns.
  5. It is ROOTED AT THIS SOURCE FILE'S OWN DIRECTORY — i.e. the value
     changes when ``import.meta.url``'s directory changes.  Rooting is
     decided by evaluating the SAME expression a second time with that
     directory replaced by a marker, so it follows through every
     intermediate binding.
  6. It does not BRANCH, and it is not an operand of a branching
     initialiser.  ``||``, ``??`` and ``? :`` are NEVER resolved, in either
     direction — see NEVER RESOLVE THROUGH A BRANCH below.
  7. Its DIRECTORY is absent from the tree as well.  A file missing from a
     directory the tree DOES hold is undecided, not a finding — see KNOWN
     CONSERVATISM.
  8. It does not descend through a directory an install or a build
     PRODUCES (``vendor/``, ``.venv/``, ``node_modules/``,
     ``build/generated/``, …).  Such a directory is legitimately absent
     from a source checkout, so its absence says nothing.  The names are
     in ``_DERIVED_SEGMENTS``.  That list is NOT complete and is not
     claimed to be: it is the one part of this rule whose blind spot cuts
     BOTH ways.  Adding a name removes sites; a derived directory whose
     name is NOT in it stays decidable, and that is exactly where the
     wrong verdicts on ``vendor/`` and ``.venv/`` came from before this
     conjunct existed.

An in-scope path that names no existing file is a FAIL: the tool that
spawns it can never run.  Everything else is UNDECIDED — printed with its
file, line, expression and reason, never silently dropped and never a FAIL.

NEVER RESOLVE THROUGH A BRANCH
------------------------------
An earlier revision walked ``||`` / ``??`` chains and returned the first
alternative naming an EXISTING path.  That is not what JS computes: ``||``
yields its LEFT operand whenever that operand is truthy and every non-empty
string is truthy, so in ``dead || live`` the path the handler spawns is the
DEAD one.  Three measured consequences, on the real pre-fix source:

  * ``const gate = <dead> || (here + "/../../programs");`` — the chain
    evaluated to a directory, the declaration no longer looked like a
    program path, and the SITE VANISHED from the report.  Not a missed
    finding: one fewer place the run said it had looked, with no signal.
  * ``const gate = <dead> || <live>;`` — the run printed the site as
    DECIDED and RESOLVED to ``<live>``.  A green CERTIFICATE naming a path
    the running code never computes.
  * ``??`` was treated as ``||`` though it takes its right operand only for
    ``null`` / ``undefined`` — a second wrong model of a second operator.

So the evaluation is gone.  A branch evaluates to UNKNOWN, and any site
whose own expression branches, or that sits inside a WRITE whose right-hand
side branches, is UNDECIDED and is printed with that reason.  Both tests are
LEXICAL, taken on the masked source: a ``?`` in a comment or a string is not
there to be seen, and a ``?.`` is optional chaining, not a ternary.
``[c].find(existsSync)`` is still evaluated — it returns the first member
that exists, which is exactly what the runtime computes — but a ``find``
standing in a branching RHS is an operand of that branch and is undecided
with it.  Such an RHS is still COLLECTED on the program name it holds
(pattern 5 in ``collect_sites``), because a branch that deleted the site
from the report would be strictly worse than a disclosed blind spot.

Conjunct 5 is the SCOPE, and it is what keeps this sound.  A path built on a
hard-coded absolute prefix names some OTHER filesystem — a container image
root (``/foss/tools/...openroad...``), a scratch directory
(``/tmp/deck_<n>.py``) — and calling it dead would be a statement about a
machine this checker is not looking at.  Out of bounds BY CONSTRUCTION, not
by an editable list of names; and adding one more ``".."`` climbs further up
but is still rooted here, so it is still judged.

BINDINGS — WHERE A NAME'S VALUE COMES FROM
------------------------------------------
Two sources, both facts about the file rather than guesses:

  * ``import.meta.url``.  A name bound to ``dirname(... import.meta.url
    ...)`` IS this file's directory, wherever in the file that binding is
    written — one file has one URL, so this needs no scope analysis.
  * A WRITE to the name: ``const`` / ``let`` / ``var NAME = <rhs>``, or a
    plain ``NAME = <rhs>``.  Which keyword — or none — stands in front of
    the ``=`` says nothing about what the RHS builds, so one rule reads all
    four.  EVERY write in the file must agree on one definite string, or
    the name is DROPPED and bound to nothing.  That covers the rebindable
    keywords (``let dir = <absent>; if (!existsSync(dir)) dir = <live>;``
    is a layout probe and binds nothing) and the two-handlers case that
    ``const`` alone used to cover: a name a handler reads is written either
    in that handler — in which case this pass sees BOTH writes and drops it
    — or in an enclosing scope, where the single value is the right one.
    A PARAMETER DEFAULT is not one of these writes: a keyword-less ``=``
    closed by a bracket instead of a ``;`` (``({ dir = <x> }) =>``,
    ``f(dir = <x>)``) supplies no value, so a path assembled from an
    argument stays UNKNOWN.  The site is still collected and printed.

WHAT THIS CHECKER DOES **NOT** DECIDE
-------------------------------------
Read this before reading a PASS as an all-clear.  Every item in THIS list
under-reports and none of them can produce a wrong verdict on correct code.
The two places where a wrong verdict is still possible are named in KNOWN
CONSERVATISM below, not here.

  * **COULD-NOT-RUN IS NOT AN EXIT STATUS — NOT COVERED HERE.**  The second
    half of the original defect was the handler answering the could-not-run
    condition with a value in the exit-status domain::

        exitCode = r.error ? 1 : (r.status ?? 1);   // "never started" -> 1
        ...
        phase23_complete: exitCode === 0,           // ...which is now a verdict

    so "the program does not exist on this machine" and "the program ran
    and the project failed" left byte-identical evidence.  A real invariant,
    and this gate DOES NOT CHECK IT.  Deciding it needs dataflow — which
    receiver a spawn bound, what a helper returns, which fields downstream
    read — and every approximation by name heuristic (callee whitelist,
    write-API list, spawn-evidence by spelling) mis-fired on correct code in
    this very tree.  A PASS here says nothing about it.
  * A path that crosses a FUNCTION BOUNDARY.  ``_runPyProgram("gate.py")``
    hands a bare program NAME to a helper that builds the path from its own
    parameter; the name is not a path and the helper's candidates are not
    this call's.  Out of scope, undecided, and the reason is printed.
  * A file that binds ONE name both to its own directory and to something
    else.  Refused (CANNOT-CHECK), not decided: see ``discover_bindings``.
  * A handler PARAMETER, including one carrying a default — the zod form
    (``programs_dir: z.string().default(<module dir>)``) and the JS form
    (``async ({ programs_dir = <module dir> }) =>``) alike.  A parameter is
    not a binding this file declares; modelling one means modelling the
    handler's scope, which is the machinery this rule was cut back from.
    This is the biggest single blind spot by count — on the shipped server
    it is nine of the twenty-two undecided sites, and every one of them is
    printed.
  * A program name that is not statically fixed — assembled from a handler
    parameter, a loop over a runtime list, or ``Date.now()``.  Evaluates to
    UNKNOWN; printed.
  * A path expression that BRANCHES, or that is an operand of a branching
    write.  See NEVER RESOLVE THROUGH A BRANCH above and the first entry
    under KNOWN CONSERVATISM below.
  * A whole COMMAND LINE in one string (``python3 ${DIR}/gate.py --json -``)
    is not read as a path: the value names a command, and splitting shell
    text into arguments is guesswork this checker does not do.
  * A path a handler WRITES rather than spawns.  Telling a generator its own
    output "exists in no shipped layout" is a wrong verdict, and telling
    written from spawned apart needs the dataflow above.  Conjuncts 4, 5 and
    7 put the shapes that occur out of bounds instead: the venue's one
    generated helper goes to a scratch directory (not own-rooted), the
    server's own source tree is excluded outright, and a file created inside
    an existing directory is an absent MEMBER.  Measured on the venue: of
    the thirteen file-writing calls in these sources, none targets a
    ``.py``.
  * A builder spelled under ANOTHER NAME — aliased
    (``const {resolve: R} = path``) or wrapped in a local helper.  The
    value is UNKNOWN, so the site is undecided; conjunct 1 keeps it in the
    printed list rather than dropping it.
  * A path built inside an OBJECT LITERAL or any other RHS this evaluator
    does not read (``const o = { gate: dir + "/gate.py" };``).  The value is
    UNKNOWN and the site is undecided — collected, under conjunct 1, on the
    program name the RHS spells, so it is printed rather than dropped.
  * A list of alternatives in which even ONE member cannot be decided: a
    live alternative cannot be ruled out, so no member is failed.
  * A source file outside the scanned venue — ``*.js`` / ``*.mjs`` / ``*.cjs``
    under the MCP source directory.  A run over a venue holding none of these
    REFUSES; one that finds files but no program paths says so in its own
    denominator (``0 program-path site(s)``).

KNOWN CONSERVATISM — WHAT WAS GIVEN UP, AND WHY
-----------------------------------------------
Most of these are FALSE NEGATIVES the rule accepts on purpose, because the
alternative was a wrong verdict on code that works.  The FOURTH entry is not
one of those: it is the one remaining shape in this file that can still
produce a wrong verdict, and it is written down here rather than patched
because the patch opens a worse hole.  Read the whole list before reading a
PASS.

  * **A BRANCH DISARMS A FINDING, and says so.**  Appending ``|| x`` to a
    dead path, or wrapping it in a ternary, moves the site from FAIL to
    UNDECIDED and rc back to 0.  That is the accepted price of never
    resolving through a branch: the alternative was picking a side, and
    picking the wrong side certified a path the code never runs.  The site
    is still counted and still printed, with the branch named as the
    reason, so the edit shows up in the report rather than deleting the
    site from it.
  * **AN ABSENT MEMBER OF A PRESENT DIRECTORY IS NOT DECIDED** (conjunct 7).
    ``programs/optional_extra.py`` missing while ``programs/`` is right
    there is what an optional program guarded by ``if (!existsSync(p))
    return {skipped:true}`` looks like, what a read inside ``try`` /
    ``catch`` with a working fallback looks like, and what a file produced
    on first use looks like.  Telling those from a defect needs the
    dataflow this checker does not carry, and a guard-detector written
    against the guards that happen to be in this tree would mis-fire on the
    next one.  The cost is real: deleting a program from ``programs/`` is
    now undecided, not a finding.  The defect this gate exists for — a path
    naming a LAYOUT that is not there — is untouched by it, because the
    layout's directory is absent too.
  * **A DERIVED TREE IS NOT DECIDED** (conjunct 8), and that exemption is a
    LIST OF NAMES, not a construction.  Moving a program path under
    ``vendor/`` is therefore a one-line way to make a site undecided.  It
    stays printed.
  * **A BRANCH OVER NAMES WRITTEN ELSEWHERE IS NOT SEEN.**
    ``const A = join(...); const B = join(...); const p = existsSync(A) ? A
    : B;`` — ``A``'s own write does not branch, so if ``A`` names a layout
    that is absent it is still a FINDING.  Writing ``A`` with ``let``
    changes nothing here: the veto is a SECOND write, not the keyword.  This
    is the one shape in this file that can still produce a wrong verdict on
    working code.  It is not closed here because following identifiers INTO
    branches would let a single inserted line — ``const _ = c ? gate :
    gate;`` — silence any finding in the file, which is a worse hole than
    the one it shuts.  The venue writes this probe as an ARRAY
    (``_programsCandidates``), and conjunct 3 covers the array form.
  * **THE SHIPPED TREE CURRENTLY DECIDES NOTHING.**  Every program path in
    it is built from ``VIBE_IC_PROGRAMS_DIR``, chosen at runtime by
    ``process.env.… || <probe> || <fallback>``.  A run over it reports
    ``0 DECIDED``, and the verdict line says so rather than "every program
    path resolves": those paths depend on an environment variable and an
    existence probe, and the earlier "6 resolved" was the branch walk
    guessing.  The defect class this gate guards — a hard-coded climb out of
    this file's own directory into a layout that does not exist — remains
    decidable, which is what the pre-fix regression test measures.

COMMENTS AND STRINGS CANNOT MOVE THIS GATE
------------------------------------------
Every structural decision is taken on a MASKED view of the source in which
comments are blanked and string / template / regex-literal CONTENT is
blanked, with byte offsets and line numbers preserved exactly.  A sentence
in a comment cannot create a finding and cannot clear one; a program name
mentioned in prose is not a call site.  The literal VALUES used to resolve
a path are read back from the original bytes at the offsets the masked scan
identified — i.e. from positions that are code by construction.

There is no suppression comment, no skip list, no per-file opt-out, and no
token that certifies anything.  The only way to change a verdict is to
change the path expression, and a changed path expression is reported at
its own file and line either as a finding or as an undecided site.

Usage:
    python3 mcp_tool_program_path_resolves_check.py <plugin_root> [--json OUT]
                                                    [--src-dir REL]

Exit codes:
    0  PASS        — every in-scope path resolved
    1  FAIL        — at least one in-scope path names no file, each named
    2  CANNOT-CHECK — the input needed was absent or unparseable, OR this
                     checker itself raised.  NOT a pass and NOT a fail: a
                     scanner bug must not impersonate a finding, so an
                     unexpected exception is caught and REFUSED rather than
                     ending the process with the same rc a real FAIL uses.
