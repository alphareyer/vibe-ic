"""#2348: the phase-2+3 completion gate must be REACHABLE, and a gate that
could not run must not be able to return a completeness verdict.

Two defects, one call site, and each half needs its own arm.

THE PATH.  The handler resolved its gate under ``vibe-ic-d``, the plugin Wave
82 retired.  ``src/index.js`` already calls that name "a plugin that no longer
exists" where ``VIBE_IC_PROGRAMS_DIR`` is defined -- and then used it anyway,
one screen down.  The resolved path exists in NO layout, installed or checkout.

WHY THE EXISTING FILE STAYED GREEN, which is the part worth copying.
``test_eda_phase23_completion_audit.py::test_canonical_gate_exists_on_disk``
searches for the gate with the TEST FILE'S OWN ``_GATE_CANDIDATES`` list, which
carries the current path as well as the legacy one.  It therefore asserts "the
gate file exists", never "the product can find it" -- a tautology with respect
to the defect.  ``test_a_the_product_resolver_reaches_the_gate`` below asks the
second question by re-deriving the path from the expression in ``index.js``
itself, so reverting the source reddens it.

THE VERDICT.  ``phase23_complete`` was derived from an exit code that four
distinct could-not-run paths all collapse into.  Two of them (ENOENT on
python3, and a host-side timeout kill) produce ``exit_code: 1`` with an EMPTY
output -- byte-identical in shape to a real "ran, and the project failed"
verdict.  ``index.js`` states the rule itself: treat "could not run" as
nothing-to-judge and you are back where this started.
