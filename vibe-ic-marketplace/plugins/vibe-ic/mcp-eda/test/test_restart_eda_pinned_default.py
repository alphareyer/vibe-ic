"""Regression: `restart-eda.sh` must default to an IMMUTABLE image reference,
never a floating `latest` — a stale local `latest` would silently recreate the
MCP-EDA container on an outdated toolchain (the same drift class fixed for
`fault_atpg_run.py` in v1.3.80). Measured on 8HD-9 2026-08-21, that risk is not
hypothetical: the local `latest` tag carried RepoDigest `sha256:549357686ed1…`
while the registry's `latest` was `sha256:f34af8763eb0…` — the same name, two
different images, in the same minute.

WHAT CHANGED. The default used to be `$(cat tools/vibeic-eda/VERSION)` —
vibeic-eda's version number stored in the vibe-ic repo, which meant a PR here for
every image release. That file is gone. The default is now a DIGEST, and the
script SHELLS OUT to `programs/_eda_image.py --judged` for it rather than growing
a second copy of "which image" in bash: two implementations of one rule is the
drift these tests exist to catch, one level up.

`RESTART_EDA_PRINT_IMAGE=1` prints the resolved ref and exits before any docker
interaction, so the argument-handling tests need no docker daemon. The default
path DOES need one — it asks this host what it has — and it says so rather than
passing when it could not look.
