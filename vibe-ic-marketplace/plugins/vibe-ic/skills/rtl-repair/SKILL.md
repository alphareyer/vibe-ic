name: rtl-repair
description: Automatically fix lint violations, synthesis errors, and simulation mismatches in RTL code. Use when the user says "fix this Verilog", "repair the RTL", "resolve these lint errors", "my synthesis is failing", or shares an HDL file with error logs from a lint/synth/sim tool.

# RTL Repair

Close the Generate-Compile-Feedback-Repair loop for RTL. Takes a broken module plus a log (lint, synthesis, or simulation) and produces a corrected module, with a diff and a reasoning trace.

## When to use

Trigger when the user:
- Shares RTL plus error output from a lint tool (SpyGlass, Verilator, Icarus)
- Reports a synthesis error from Yosys, DC, or Genus
- Reports a simulation mismatch where golden and DUT differ
- Asks to "auto-fix" the issues surfaced by `/rtl-review`

## Inputs to gather

1. The RTL file(s)
2. The error log or failing-test output
3. Intent: "minimal fix" (patch only the error) vs "refactor for cleanliness"
4. Whether to preserve original comments and signal names

## Repair workflow

1. **Parse the error log** — group issues by root cause, not by line count. One fix often resolves many lints.
2. **Rank by severity** — synthesis-blocking errors first, then warnings, then style issues.
3. **Plan the patch** — for each root cause, describe the fix in one sentence before touching the code.
4. **Apply minimal edits** — prefer surgical diffs over rewrites unless the user asked for a refactor.
5. **Re-check mentally** — walk the new code through the failing case and confirm the fix is valid.
6. **Emit diff + explanation** — show what changed and why.

## Output format

Produce:

```
# RTL Repair — <filename>

## Root causes identified
1. <root cause 1> → <line range> → <fix strategy>
2. ...

## Patch
```diff
- <old line>
+ <new line>
```

## Why each change works
- <change 1>: <one-sentence justification tied to the spec or lint rule>

## Remaining risks
- <anything the repair couldn't address without more info>

## Next step
Re-run /rtl-review to confirm clean, then /testbench-gen or existing tests.
```

## Technical basis

Implements the iterative repair loop from AutoChip, RTLFixer, and VerilogCoder. Empirical result: iterative compile-feedback-repair lifts functional correctness of LLM-generated RTL by 20–40% over single-shot generation.

## Declared in-order transaction watchdog (Program First)

A single-flight timer that clears on any completion is not a multi-outstanding
watchdog. The reusable mechanism is enforced by
`programs/in_order_watchdog_synth.py`, consumed by the existing
`canonical_primitive_synth.py` project front door and the normal RTL runner's
canonical-primitive path. It emits a new candidate only; it never replaces an
existing design or marks it functionally accepted.

Before emission, map the PUBLIC input to `input/in_order_watchdog.json`.
Mapping the prose's policy choices is explicit AI/owner work, not a regex guess.
Use schema `vibeic.in_order_watchdog.v1` and declare all of:

- `module` and distinct `ports` roles: `clock`, `reset`, `request_valid`,
  `request_ready`, `response_done`, `threshold`, `timed_out`, `violation`.
- `counter_bits` (1..64), `max_accepted` (1..1024), and `response_order:
  "in_order"`. Capacity is that bound plus ONE stalled slot only for
  `start: "first_valid"`; `start: "accepted"` measures accepted requests only.
  Declare `request_protocol: "hold_valid_until_accepted"`; cancellation is
  unsupported. Withdrawing a stalled VALID or accepting above the bound also
  asserts the runtime contract violation rather than silently losing a timer.
- `reset: {"polarity": "high"|"low", "synchrony": "sync"|"async"}` and
  `flag: "sticky_until_reset"|"pulse"`. Never clear a prompt-sticky flag on
  completion or idle. Other clear policies are unsupported, not defaulted.
- `initial_age: 0`, `timeout_compare: "next_age_ge"`, `saturation: "max"`,
  `zero_latency: "complete_on_accept"`, and `violation_policy:
  "sticky_until_reset"`. Age zero is stored on the start edge; existing
  next-age >= runtime threshold is compared on each subsequent sampling edge.
  Threshold zero also trips a new entry. A same-edge accepted completion with
  no older work creates no unfinished entry. Retiring the oldest does not
  suppress comparisons for other transactions.
- `mapping: {"actor": "AI"|"owner", "source": "input/<public>.md",
  "sha256": "<source digest>", "citations": {...}}`. Supply a nonempty exact
  source quote for EACH field above (including `module`, `ports`, `reset` and
  all policy fields; exclude `schema` and `mapping`). Hash and quote checking
  binds the source; it does NOT prove the mapping entails the policy. Retain
  the mapping for independent AI review and normal Program gates.

Invoke the ACTUAL shared consumer, not an unused utility:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/programs/canonical_primitive_synth.py <project> --emit
```

EMIT is generation, not PASS of the repaired design. Existing RTL is never
clobbered: the normal runner defers to authored/supplied RTL, and this explicit
CLI refuses an occupied output. Missing declaration leaves ordinary canonical
detection unchanged; incomplete/changed source, malformed parameters, unknown
policy or out-of-order retirement emits `WATCHDOG_CONTRACT_REFUSED` and writes
no candidate. Runtime capacity overflow or orphan completion asserts the
declared sticky `violation` output; the integrator must treat it as a contract
failure, not waive it or silently drop outstanding work.

Verify at least: first completion with a second request still unfinished;
held VALID versus consecutive accepts; simultaneous pop/push; threshold 0/1
and runtime changes; saturation; reset polarity/synchrony and sticky/pulse
policy. Re-run the original independent challenge, normal gates and fresh
review before claiming repair acceptance. A prepared product capture is not
closed while those checks or publication are pending.

## Do not

- Do not silently change module interfaces — if a port must change, flag it explicitly
- Do not delete code to make errors go away; fix the root cause
- Do not repair if the root cause is ambiguous; ask the user instead

## Modify-task file delivery — extend, don't replace (issue #139 class)

When the repair/modification deliverable is one of the PROVIDED files and your
change adds a NEW module that instantiates the provided one, the delivered
file must contain BOTH: the original module (verbatim except the requested
edits) AND the new logic. Overwriting the file with only the new module
deletes the definition the new logic depends on — the design stops
elaborating (unknown module) and every pre-existing consumer breaks.
"Extend" means the given design plus your addition; deleting provided logic
requires an explicit instruction to replace it.

Deterministic backstop (run before delivering):

```bash
python3 plugins/vibe-ic/programs/file_extend_preserve_check.py \
    --before <original_files_dir> --after <delivered_files_dir>
```

Exit 1 = self-breaking clobber (an overwritten definition the delivered set
still instantiates) — restore the original module alongside the new one.

*why_not_bucket_a*: whether dropping a provided module that NOTHING still
instantiates was an INTENDED replacement is task-wording judgment — that half
stays advisory (IC Expert DB class `functional-modification-delivery`); the
program flags only the zero-false-positive self-breaking sub-case.

## ⛔ ECO spare-cell preservation (mandatory)

> ⛔ **ECO spare-cell preservation:** cells/gates/pads carrying the `dont_touch` /
> `keep` attribute (or otherwise tagged spare/ECO) are RESERVED for a future
> metal-only ECO. NEVER delete, resize, re-purpose, or optimize them away. RTL
> repair edits source HDL, but if a fix touches the gate netlist or adds
> `(* keep *)` removal / dead-code elimination, it must NOT strip the spare-cell
> instantiations or their keep attributes (no `opt_clean` / `clean -purge` /
> `remove_buffers` on keep-marked instances). After any repair,
> `spare_cell_preservation_check.py` MUST still PASS (spare set + keep attrs
> intact, 0 removed); if your repair drops a spare it is a regression — restore
> it and re-run the checker. See the `design-for-eco` skill.

## Compliance gate (mandatory)

After producing your output, save it to a file and run:

```bash
python3 plugins/vibe-ic/_shared/skill_compliance_check.py \
    --requirements plugins/vibe-ic/skills/rtl-repair/compliance.yaml \
    <your_output_file>
```

Exit 0 = PASS, exit 1 = FAIL with specific missing elements listed.
`compliance.yaml` in the corresponding skill directory enumerates
every required element of your output: section headers, metadata fields,
handoff lines, tool invocations.

**Your task is not complete until the audit returns PASS.** Missing
elements are the single largest source of skill-execution non-determinism
across different agents.
